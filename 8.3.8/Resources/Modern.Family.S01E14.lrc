[00:01.87](Claire) Those pancakes smell great.
[00:04.08]What are you doing with those?
[00:05.67]Luke and I are doing a recycling drive.
[00:07.25]If we collect enough bottles, they build a school in Africa.
[00:09.38]Wouldn't that be so cool to go to a school made out of bottles?
[00:13.05]That would certainly be a special school.
[00:16.22]Did you hear what I said, parents? "Special school"?
[00:19.31]Okay, nobody make a big deal about it, but I just broke up with Dylan.
[00:22.56]No! Oh, my gosh. Are you okay, honey?
[00:25.23]Yeah, I'm fine. I just-
[00:27.23]I need to date someone who has a clue,
[00:29.28]instead of an idiot who bangs his head...
[00:31.28]every time he rides his bike out of his garage- every time!
[00:34.45]I'm sorry, honey.
[00:37.16]I'm sorry for both of you. I'll have to text him later.
[00:40.95]Mmm. I gotta jump in the shower. I'm gonna be late.
[00:43.04]- Where are you going? - I'm going to meet my friend Valerie.
[00:45.25]I haven't seen her in 15 years. We used to work together.
[00:47.63]- You worked? - Mm-hmm.
[00:49.71]Can't imagine you working. Luke, let me tell you something.
[00:51.76]That is very offensive to women.
[00:53.76]Your mom works very hard. It's just now she works for us.
[00:58.89]I will have you know that I had quite the little career going.
[01:01.52]I was an account manager at Starcrest Hotels.
[01:04.06]I had a little cubicle, and-and I wore my tennis shoes to work...
[01:07.31]and changed into my work pumps.
[01:08.81]Itwas very Working Girl.
[01:10.40]That movie's so clutch. Mm-hmm.
[01:12.40]I don't mind saying I was making quite a splash.
[01:14.90]- Well, then, why'd you quit? - Well, Haley, call me old-fashioned,
[01:18.03]but I wanted to focus on raising a family.
[01:19.99]So I married your dad.
[01:22.12]Five months later, we... were...
[01:24.71]four months away from having this little bundle of joy.
[01:28.08]Mm-hmm.
[01:32.00]There's my lawyer.
[01:34.22]Gloria got into a little car accident,
[01:36.22]so my dad asked me to help her out.
[01:38.22]And, uh, this is the first time that my dad's asked me for legal advice,
[01:42.01]and it's- it's nice.
[01:44.02]It's nice to know that he respects me in that way.
[01:46.31]Well, Mitchell is an amazing lawyer. Oh.
[01:48.60]My dream for him is that one day he'll be on the Supreme Court.
[01:51.57]Why, Cam?
[01:53.86]So at parties I can tell everyone my partner is one of the Supremes.
[01:59.20]There he is- the steely, grizzled veteran...
[02:02.41]ready to do battle with the plucky upstart.
[02:04.58]Speed versus grace. Brute force versus-
[02:07.08]- Let's just do this. - (Cameron) Jay and I are both gym rats.
[02:09.92]I love the sauna. That's the dry heat.
[02:11.92]And the steam, wet.
[02:13.55]And, of course, I am just a kook for racquetball.
[02:16.47]Club champ two years in a row, Tonganoxie, Missouri Rec Center.
[02:20.72]So, naturally, Jay and I have been trying for months...
[02:24.56]to get together to bang the old hollow rubber ball around.
[02:29.52]I have been avoiding this day like the plague.
[02:31.94]I mean, part of going to the gym is the locker-room atmosphere.
[02:35.40]And if I'm there with a gay guy, it's-it's just not gonna be the same.
[02:38.49]I mean, for me, it's a locker room.
[02:40.61]For him, it's a showroom.
[02:43.70]She doesn't get it.
[02:45.91](Man) â™?Hey, hey â™?
[02:48.00]â™?Hey, hey Hey, hey â™?
[02:52.08]â™?Hey, hey Hey â™ªâ™ª
[02:57.51]â™?Driving in my car â™?
[03:00.63]â™?I'll let you see my scar â™ªâ™ª
[03:04.56]- What the hell? - (Car Door Opens)
[03:11.27]Some people call me a salesman. I call myself a sales friend.
[03:14.73]So obviously, I need strangers to trust me.
[03:16.82]I don't take kindly to it when someone Tom Sellecks my bus bench.
[03:19.65](Beeps) Phil Dunphy.
[03:21.66]Phil, it's Barbara. The Pattersons wanna back out of the deal.
[03:23.82]Why? What happened? The wife's getting cold feet.
[03:26.66]I told her to call you. Okay, fine.
[03:29.41]I'll handle it. I'm not losing this sale.
[03:32.46]By the way- I've spent way too much time on it.
[03:34.50]Phil, do you take Elm when you come to work? I saw it, Barbara.
[03:37.46](Phone Beeps)
[03:45.26]It's a terrific gym, Jay.
[03:47.26]Very liberal with the towels. I love that.
[03:49.27]Showers are private, in case you wondered.
[03:51.44]I wasn't, but thanks for the heads-up.
[03:54.27]Now, that's a surprise. Boxers. Is that necessary?
[03:57.69]Well, I just always pictured you as a tighty-whitey guy.
[04:00.49]Well, do me a favor. The next time you picture me, leave the underwear out of it.
[04:03.91]Well, don't you worry. The only thing I'm picturing...
[04:05.87]is how clean the floor's gonna be when I'm done mopping it with you.
[04:09.16](Chuckling) Is that the best you can do?
[04:11.00]'Cause it's gonna take a little more than some lame trash talk to get me out of my-
[04:14.33]Gaah! What the hell was that?
[04:16.29]Our butts pressed against each other.
[04:17.84]They didn't press. It was glancing. Stop talking about it!
[04:20.34]All the time you've spent in a locker room, this can't be your first moon landing.
[04:23.63]- You got a name for it? - It's very common.
[04:25.59]You got off easy. At least it didn't happen after a shower.
[04:27.72]Enough. We call that a splashdown.
[04:29.81]That's it. I'm changing in the stall. Excuse me!
[04:35.77]I saw the picture, Dylan.
[04:37.77]You had your arm around her with that humpy look you get.
[04:41.07]No, that's not always how you look. We're over!
[04:43.90](Phone Beeps) So, I'd really like to talk to you, Mrs. Patterson,
[04:46.37]see if we can't turn this thing around.
[04:48.20]Uh, you've got my number. (Phone Rings)
[04:49.74]Thank you. I said we are over.
[04:52.66]Why don't you go out for a nice bike ride?
[04:54.58](Beeps) Dylan again, huh?
[04:56.58]Some guys just do not know how to play it.
[05:00.09]- Dad, what are you doing? - Oh, right.
[05:02.21]Just, uh, test-driving my new soup strainer.
[05:04.43]I dug it out of the Halloween stuff to see what people think.
[05:11.89]Do people want their real estate advice...
[05:14.52]from someone who leads or from someone who follows?
[05:17.52]I'm betting these babies are coming back in a big way.
[05:19.82]Buy low, sell high.
[05:21.57]People are gonna see this and say, "That guy's high."
[05:27.07]Sorry to bother you, sir. We're doing work next door and nicked a main,
[05:29.66]so we're gonna have to shut down your water.
[05:31.33]Oh. Okay. No problem.
[05:33.04]It shouldn't be too long. If you need it, there's a porta-potty out front.
[05:36.00]Thanks. Hey. Yeah.
[05:37.71]Nice mustache. (Chuckles)
[05:39.71]Yeah, man. You too, brother.
[05:44.26]"You too, brother."
[05:49.64]Haley- She's the oldest. Fifteen.
[05:52.72]And then Alex is 13.
[05:54.73]And that's my baby, Luke. He's 11. Can you believe it? Oh, my God, they're gorgeous.
[05:58.73]Yeah. And things are still good with Phil the Thrill?
[06:01.57]Yes. Things are great. Great with him.
[06:03.82]I'm so happy for you. Really. I'm so- I'm so happy that you're happy.
[06:07.78](Laughs) Thank you. Well, and you too.
[06:10.28]I mean, your life is- No, no, no- Let's talk about you.
[06:13.29]Okay. Because, you know, you're-
[06:16.16]You chose the mother. You're the mommy.
[06:18.96]The yummy mommy, mama-
[06:20.58]Uh-huh? Person.
[06:21.63](Laughs)
[06:23.17]You're kinda squeezing the ring right into my finger. Was I?
[06:26.59]A little. I'm so sorry.
[06:28.59]And just then, it hit me. She was jealous of me.
[06:32.14]Yes, there'd always been a little bit of a competition between us.
[06:34.81]This was more serious.
[06:37.27]She was looking at my life as something...
[06:39.98]that she'd always wanted, but never had.
[06:43.15]So how's life in the trenches?
[06:44.65]You still got the bastards on the 23rd floor...
[06:46.65]making life miserable for all the people actually doing the work.
[06:49.28]Same as ever, right? One- One difference.
[06:52.83]Mm-hmm? I'm one of them bastards now.
[06:54.83]Wait. You're on the 23rd floor? I'm on the 24th floor.
[06:57.58]Wow. That's insane. It's- It's no big deal.
[07:00.54]I mean, if you hadn't left, it probably would have been you.
[07:08.42](Gloria) I was driving along this street. The cars were parked just like this.
[07:12.55]And boom- Out of nowhere, he hits me.
[07:15.47]Okay, so, he-he cut you off? Yes.
[07:17.60]Right. A crazy driver.
[07:19.60]You know, I used to be a little bit like that.
[07:21.69]I don't know, maybe it's because of Lily, but I've definitely become more considerate.
[07:24.94]Like, I used to never let people in, and now I do.
[07:28.61]Just now getting that metaphor. Okay.
[07:32.16]So, what do you think? Were there any witnesses?
[07:34.28]No, just Manny. He was in the back seat.
[07:36.54]Okay. It all happened so fast- Just like they say.
[07:39.37]Yeah. All right. Well, this is what we're gonna do.
[07:41.37]I'll take a few pictures, and then we'll sit down and write a statement.
[07:44.08]Perfect. I'll go and get us a table.
[07:46.00]All right. Manny, come.
[07:48.01]Uh, just a minute, Mom. I need to tie my shoe. Okay.
[07:50.76]- Mitchell. - Yeah?
[07:52.59]Don't talk. Listen. It was her fault.
[07:54.97]- I'm sorry. What? - Don't look at me. Do something. Take pictures.
[07:59.48]Manny! What kind of cupcake do you want?
[08:02.23]Um, that's okay. I'm not hungry.
[08:05.11]That was a mistake. Now she'II know something's up.
[08:07.98]- Are you okay? - I'm fine.
[08:11.11]She cut that guy off. She's a terrible driver.
[08:13.41]She's a danger to us all. Okay, wait. Now stop.
[08:16.28]I thought she said he was parked and then he cut her off.
[08:19.12]Everybody looks parked when you're going a hundred miles an hour.
[08:21.54]Manny, why didn't you speak up?
[08:23.96]She can't take criticism about her driving.
[08:26.42]Once an old lady yelled at her at a crosswalk.
[08:28.50]She honked so long, the horn ran out.
[08:30.51]Manny!
[08:33.43]I've said too much already.
[08:36.22](Sighs)
[08:38.22]Are you hearing this?
[08:43.69]Aw, that's- Point.
[08:47.27]Hinder!
[08:48.36](Jay) Oh!
[08:49.94]Boom. Lucky shot!
[08:51.99]That is game and, I believe, match.
[08:54.74]Yeah, fine, you won. But, you know, what do you expect?
[08:57.99]For the first half of the game, I was distracted by what happened in the locker room.
[09:01.33]And you're sure it's not because I'm a fabulous racquetball player?
[09:04.33]You're average. But I was a little thrown by you touching me.
[09:07.00]Which is unnatural- Not to you, of course.
[09:09.29]- No, to you it's like rocket fuel. - Oh, sure.
[09:11.46]When you're gay you just walk around giving butt bumps to everybody.
[09:14.43]It's like a high five. It's a low two.
[09:16.43]You know what? I'm gonna prove that you won only because I was distracted.
[09:19.81]We're gonna have a rematch right here, right now.
[09:22.22]So you want to go up against me again? Yes.
[09:24.23]No! Damn it.
[09:26.06]- (Cell Phone Rings) - (Jay) Hello!
[09:28.06]Hey, Dad. Uh, did you know that the accident was Gloria's fault?
[09:30.98]Yes. I mean, I wasn't there, but she's a horrible driver.
[09:33.65]If she hit 10 cars, I wouldn't be surprised.
[09:35.36]If you knew it was her fault, why did you get me involved?
[09:37.53]Because someone has to tell her she's in the wrong, and better you than me.
[09:40.58]That's great. Here I am thinking that my dad actually respects me as a lawyer,
[09:43.79]and really you're just throwing me to the wolves.
[09:45.79]- Can't it be both? - Okay. Dad, it doesn't bother you in the least...
[09:49.00]that your gay son is the only one tough enough to stand up to your wife?
[09:51.92]Go get 'em, Rocky. See you later.
[09:53.92]Your father and I had a moon landing in the locker room. What's the matter with you?
[09:57.26]What about you? Do you ever get serious with anyone? Thank you.
[10:01.10]Sure. Oh, no. Not yet.
[10:02.97]Oh, honey, you will.
[10:05.23]Oh, no, I hope not. It's- It's fun.
[10:07.98]I'm sorry. I'm just- I'm waiting for some news.
[10:09.98]What news? I'm- I'm up for the Paris job.
[10:13.36]The-The head of the international division?
[10:16.03]That's- That's- That's crazy.
[10:18.03]Yeah, no. I mean, I'll never get it, but it'd be great...
[10:20.24]'cause one of my lovers lives in Paris.
[10:22.24]Wow. I-I don't know what jumps out of that sentence more-
[10:26.00]you know, "lovers" or "one of."
[10:28.04]Well, I'm single. I mean, it's kinda what you do.
[10:30.92]Uh-huh. I have one in Paris.
[10:33.30]Oh. Um, I have Paris, New York, Miami.
[10:37.38]I have a fourth one.
[10:39.18]I'm forgetting one lover. I'm forgetting one lover. Mmm.
[10:42.05]Last night I vacuumed the radiator thingy under the fridge.
[10:44.97]You know, it collects the dust. 'Cause you should, and I don't. So-
[10:48.77](Cell Phone Rings) Oh, hey, hold on. Cross your fingers.
[10:51.81]I'm not gonna lie.
[10:53.94]The thought of Valerie getting the one job in the whole company that everyone coveted-
[10:57.07]Well, I wasn't a "lover" of that.
[10:59.36]Okay. Okay, thank you.
[11:02.53](Beeps) Well?
[11:04.66]Oh, they haven't made a decision.
[11:06.66]They're- They're gonna tell me later on.
[11:09.16]That's not what they said, is it? Uh, yeah, it is.
[11:11.83]Oh, Valerie, come on. It's me.
[11:13.92]What are friends for, if not to be there for you when you get bad news?
[11:17.13]I got it. Oh, my God. Aaah!
[11:19.80]I'm the head of Europe. Well, you know, for the hotel-
[11:23.05]Not the continent. Kind of though. Kind of.
[11:26.56]Why didn't you tell me when you first heard?
[11:30.44]Oh, 'cause, you know-
[11:32.94]And that's when it really hit me.
[11:35.36]Valerie wasn't jealous of me. She pitied me.
[11:38.11]And part of me wanted to take her back to the house...
[11:41.20]and show her everything she was missing...
[11:43.45]in her sad, childless, husbandless life.
[11:46.87]But there's a little thing called "taking the high road."
[11:51.75]Why don't you come by and meet everybody? Oh, sure. That'd be great.
[11:55.13]Yeah, I mean, Alex is just a genius,
[11:57.30]and Haley is turning into this beautiful young woman,
[12:00.38]and it makes me realize that motherhood is- San Francisco.
[12:03.34]The most important- That was my fourth lover. San Francisco.
[12:05.85]It would have kept me up all night. Yeah.
[12:09.77]Dad, look.
[12:11.77]Just a sec, buddy. I'm on my way out to the bathroom.
[12:13.98]Check it out. The Aubreys had this huge party last night,
[12:16.15]and we got all these bottles to recycle.
[12:17.90]Great. What's JÃ¤germeister?
[12:20.49]Um-
[12:23.20]Well, you know how in a fairy tale...
[12:25.41]there's always a potion that makes the princess fall asleep,
[12:27.70]and then the guys start kissing her?
[12:29.62]Well, this is like that, except you don't wake up in a castle,
[12:32.75]you wake up in a frat house with a bad reputation.
[12:38.46](Door Closes)
[12:47.05](Engine Off)
[12:52.64]Haley!
[13:00.03]- Luke, you're spilling it! - Aw, crud.
[13:02.57]God- (Squeaking)
[13:03.70](Screams) Gross! A rat!
[13:05.74]Cool. (Doorbell Ringing)
[13:08.03](Haley) Hang on. I'm coming.
[13:13.29]I believe you have something that belongs to me.
[13:16.38]My heart. I thought I I.M.'ed you to stay away.
[13:20.50]Ow! Haley.
[13:27.14]Hello? Dylan? D-Money?
[13:30.81]Hey, buddy! Hey, buddy!
[13:34.14]Hello, friendly neighbors!
[13:35.98]Little help?
[13:38.23]- But I love you. - Well, you should have thought about that...
[13:40.69]before you took that skank Sharon Nicolini to an Anne Hathaway movie.
[13:44.40]I didn't take her. She was just there.
[13:46.03]So you were just there by yourself at an Anne Hathaway movie?
[13:49.87]I don't think so! Yeah. Yeah. I like her movies.
[13:53.75]She's every woman. Come on. Let's not fight.
[13:56.71]- Let's just discuss this like two un-immature adults. - Oh!
[14:01.46](Clears Throat) (Ringing)
[14:04.26]Oh. Oh. (Beeps)
[14:06.13]Hello? Mrs. Patterson.
[14:07.72]Hi. I've been waiting for your call.
[14:09.80]Yeah. Uh, is there any chance that maybe we could talk a little bit-
[14:13.02]No, no, no, no. Now's perfect. That's fine.
[14:15.56]I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Let me just close my office door.
[14:19.15]There we go. Much, much better.
[14:24.61]Okay. Maybe, uh, we should go over the accident one more time.
[14:27.74]Put the dogs on a row. You're such a good lawyer.
[14:31.37]Uh, I just wanna make sure we're 100% clear on exactly what happened.
[14:34.95]Oh, we're clear. I told you.
[14:37.21]What? You don't believe me?
[14:40.75]No, no. I just-
[14:42.75]You know, sometimes you can forget tiny details.
[14:44.96]Like, is it possible, maybe, uh, you were driving too fast?
[14:49.09]Who said I was driving fast? Yeah, who?
[14:52.60]I just- I'm looking at the street,
[14:54.47]and I'm thinking if you were driving a little fast,
[14:56.85]- it's possible that maybe you didn't see the car- - You're like everyone else, huh?
[15:01.02]You blame the Latino driver. Where I come from, they always blame the Latino driver.
[15:05.15]Where you come from, isn't everybody a Latino driver?
[15:07.53]Manny, tell him. I can't 'cause I have a cupcake in my mouth.
[15:10.99]Oh, come on. Don't blame your cupcake.
[15:13.16]What? You think I'm guilty too?
[15:15.20]No. Fine.
[15:17.20]I don't need you as a lawyer anymore.
[15:19.75]And if you two think I'm such a bad driver,
[15:22.50]you're safer walking home.
[15:24.50]- Chao. - (Mouths Word)
[15:28.34]Here it is. It's really cute.
[15:31.01]Yeah. We're pretty proud of it.
[15:33.10]Here's your stupid CDs...
[15:35.35]and your clothes and your poems!
[15:37.68]Don't you do it! Oh, I'm doing it.
[15:40.23]- Haley, stop it. What are you doing? - Tearing out my heart.
[15:43.77]Oh, why don't you go get a hickey from Sharon Nicolini?
[15:46.94]It's from my guitar strap, Haley.
[15:49.57]Oh, thanks for reminding me. That's my daughter Haley-
[15:52.36](Objects Crash) (Dylan Groans)
[15:53.91]And her boyfriend, Dylan, um-
[15:56.87]This is a nice color. Yeah.
[15:58.91]Um, listen. This is not normal,
[16:01.08]with all that, nor- nor is that liquor smell.
[16:03.88]Phil, honey? Oh, my God. Luke, what is that?
[16:07.38]Dad says it makes girls easier to kiss. JÃ¤germeister.
[16:10.59]- What happened to the rug? - I had an accident.
[16:13.09]- Okay. Alex, what are you doing? - I'm trying to kill a rat.
[16:16.35]Okay-
[16:18.39](Dylan) Sharon was helping me buy you a birthday present.
[16:20.56]Don't you get it? I love your ass.
[16:22.64]I- You know, I- I-I'm late and I should go.
[16:26.19]I know. I know. Yeah.
[16:27.90]And it seems like things have gotten a little wonky around here.
[16:30.57]I don't know where Phil is. He's definitely-
[16:33.16](Both Scream)
[16:35.16]Oh, my God. Alex-
[16:37.20]Where's your father? He went outside to go to the bathroom.
[16:40.37]Uh-huh. Ooh!
[16:42.41]It's... not usually like this. Oh, gross.
[16:47.38]Let's just get married. Okay.
[16:49.92](Phil) You will not regret this decision, Mrs. Patterson.
[16:52.97]And I'll tell you what. We're gonna have you over to our little house to celebrate.
[16:56.05]Okay? Okay, bye-bye. You should come back again-
[16:57.85]sometime, when you get a break- Claire! Claire!
[17:01.02]- Hey. - Phil, what are you- What are you doing?
[17:03.48]Just concluding a little business. Very successfully, I might add.
[17:07.19]Honey- Hey!
[17:08.86]- Hi. - Is that Valerie?
[17:10.15]- (Valerie) Yeah. - Wow!
[17:12.11]You look fantastic. Thank you.
[17:13.74]Come here. Get over here.
[17:15.95]Okay.
[17:18.03]How long has it been? A long time.
[17:20.04]- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, I can't touch you. Okay.
[17:22.04]A little bit difficult. Gulf divides us, eh?
[17:24.71]So nice to see you. It's great to see you though-
[17:26.67]Okay. All right.
[17:27.92]Okay, then. Thanks for coming by.
[17:29.79]It's such a pleasure. Bye-bye.
[17:31.21]Thanks for stopping by. You have a beautiful family.
[17:33.05]She looks great, doesn't she? What is on your face?
[17:41.68]One time! Once!
[17:43.77]One time I bring somebody home...
[17:45.81]who I want to impress, and what do I find?
[17:48.19]A bunch of booze-drenched hill people...
[17:51.15]just sitting around in their underwear and-and chasing rats...
[17:53.86]and fornicating in the stairwell.
[17:56.03]Can I say something? No. No, you can't, Mario.
[17:59.12]There is nothing left to say but thank you.
[18:01.70]Thank you all.
[18:12.92]Ow!
[18:14.92]I told you I'd win. (Shower Running)
[18:16.68]Not talking so much now, are you, hotshot?
[18:18.89](Water Off) Hope you enjoy that nice, hot shower,
[18:21.76]but it's not gonna wash away the shame of that 15-7 beatdown.
[18:26.39]You should have seen the look on your face...
[18:29.44]when that drop shot just kissed the wall.
[18:31.44](Chuckling) Ah. Okay, splashdown.
[18:33.78]Got me again. Yep.
[18:36.32]Make the uptight straight guy all embarrassed.
[18:38.41]Except for one thing- Doesn't even bother me anymore.
[18:40.70]I could do this all day. Here, another one for you.
[18:43.87]Maybe a couple of 'em. (Chuckles)
[18:46.08]Jay, I just noticed a sauna back here.
[18:47.75]How big of a hurry are we in? Biggest hurry of your life.
[18:51.92]'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
[18:54.17]Well, if you're going to be stranded,
[18:56.17]might as well be in a place full of cupcakes.
[18:58.22]I don't think you need any more.
[19:01.09]Ay. I'm sorry, guys.
[19:04.01]It's true- I am a defensive driver.
[19:07.48]You mean you're defensive about- I know what I am.
[19:10.73]Let's go.
[19:12.73]It's just that I don't like when people just assume that I'm a bad driver.
[19:17.90]Maybe it was just, like, a little bit my fault.
[19:20.49]Well, I'm glad you can admit that, Gloria.
[19:22.53]But I'm still gonna need you as my lawyer, Mitch.
[19:25.87]Why? Because this one-
[19:27.33]It was not my fault, I promise you.
[19:33.04]That's what that sound was. It was the big cupcake.
[19:37.13]That was unreal. Mom was crazy.
[19:39.22]I'm scared.
[19:41.22]Look. I know your mom pretty well. She's fine.
[19:45.14]I'd be willing to bet she's just composing herself,
[19:48.02]taking a nice, long, peaceful walk in the park.
[19:57.15](Squirts)
[19:59.86](Muffled) Perfect.
[20:02.82](Claire) At that moment all I wanted was to be with my family.
[20:06.70]But of course, that meant finding a way to apologize...
[20:09.29]to the people that I had belittled and rejected.
[20:12.37]- (Groans) - Okay, you are so crazy. That song totally rules.
[20:15.50](Alex) Daddy, you're crazy. Crazy right.
[20:17.96]Hey, honey. Hi.
[20:19.30](Luke) Hey, Mom. Come on. Sit down.
[20:20.88]No, seriously, Dad. It's lame. Seriously, Luke. It's not.
[20:24.14]You got some mustard or something on your face.
[20:26.18]I think I know a little bit about music. I was a deejay in college.
[20:28.97]I had my own show- in the coveted time slot.
[20:31.60]Daybreak with Dunphy. (Haley) Are you kidding me?
[20:34.10]No, I'm not kidding you. And I played Rick Astley.
[20:36.82]Dad, that's embarrassing. Never gonna give- Sing it, Luke.
[20:39.53](Claire) They could have been petty.
[20:41.53]They really could have made me pay, but they didn't.
[20:44.57]Never loved 'em more.
[20:46.57]Why the hell couldn't Valerie have seen them like that?
[20:53.00](Man On Phone) â™?Stars are falling from the sky â™?
[20:58.96]Hey, Dylan. â™?And you're the reason â™?
[21:02.38]- Hey, Mr. Dunphy. - What's happening?
[21:05.47]Well, Haley and I got into another fight.
[21:07.60]Oh- Say Anything.
[21:11.77]Um, good morning?
[21:14.19]No. Say Anything. Newspaper.
[21:17.77]No, Dylan. SayAnything. Clutch movie.
[21:20.32]Clutch movie.
[21:22.61]She probably won't be up for a couple hours still.
[21:25.95]It's okay. It's not that heavy.
