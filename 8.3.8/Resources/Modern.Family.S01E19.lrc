[00:01.66]Today Sam Riley kicked a soccer ball...
[00:04.17]and it hit another kid so hard his eye popped out.
[00:07.34]Awesome!
[00:08.84]Really? His eye popped out.
[00:10.84]Never mind. (Phil) Well, gotta hit the sack. Big Saturday tomorrow.
[00:13.30]That's right. It's somebody's birthday.
[00:15.93]Not just that. The iPad comes out-
[00:18.10]on my actual birthday.
[00:20.27]It's like Steve Jobs and God got together to say, "We love you, Phil."
[00:23.52]What is so great about that doohickey anyhow? "Doohickey," Elly May?
[00:27.02]It's a movie theater, a library and a music store...
[00:30.74]all rolled into one awesome pad.
[00:33.40]A library is a place where people get books.
[00:35.95]A movie theater is a place where people go on dates.
[00:38.95]I better load the beach chair into the trunk. I'm gonna need it for the line in the morning.
[00:42.04]Wait, honey. Hang on. You can't spend your birthday in line.
[00:45.50]Well, not the whole day. I have to be there at 6:00, or forget about it.
[00:48.88]Then I'm out by 10:00. Why don't you let me do it?
[00:51.09]Claire, you don't have to do that.
[00:53.01]No, I know, but I want to.
[00:55.05]And that way on your birthday you'll wake up and you'll have your brand-new toy.
[01:01.02]Okay.
[01:02.64]Well, in spite of you calling it a toy,
[01:05.02]this is shaping up to top the best birthday I ever had.
[01:08.02]Oh, thank God we didn't have to hear that stupid story about that place-
[01:11.11]It was called the Fun Zone. I was 11. (Groans)
[01:13.40]I hit 10 straight fastballs in the batting cage.
[01:16.49]Then my best friend Jeff Sweeney stepped in and took one in the groin.
[01:20.41]I yelled out "Ball two!" Everybody laughed.
[01:25.00]That was when I knew I was funny.
[01:29.04]Good night.
[01:31.38]B-E-L-I-E-V-E. Believe.
[01:35.38]Are you sure there's not an "E-I" in the middle?
[01:38.05]No. It's "I-E." Good, papi!
[01:39.85]If I can't fool you, then your teachers can't fool you either.
[01:42.93]I don't think they're trying to fool me.
[01:45.43]Wait until you see what I got Phil for his birthday.
[01:47.44]I found it on the SkyMall catalog.
[01:49.94]Ay. It's not one of those talking alarm clocks?
[01:52.94]"It's 6:05. It's 6:25. Wake up. Wake up."
[01:56.57]Even better. A rosewood chess set.
[01:59.49]As matter of fact, before I wrap this thing, what say we take it for a spin?
[02:02.54]- Come on, Manny. I'll teach you. - He knows how to play. His father taught him.
[02:05.62]I'm gonna teach him real chess, not the Colombian version.
[02:08.62]We actually use the pieces to play the game, not smuggle stuff out of the country.
[02:12.13]Uh, I know one Colombian piece you won't be playing with later.
[02:15.13]Manny, come on. Let's see what you got. You'll be surprised.
[02:19.14](Spanish)
[02:22.56]Manny's an excellent player, but Jay is a grumpy loser.
[02:26.35]He mopes, he makes the face, he slams the door, then he said he didn't slam the door.
[02:31.23]It's better that he wins.
[02:36.07](Crying On Baby Monitor)
[02:39.78]Um, I got this.
[02:45.24](Man On Baby Monitor) Everything's gonna be okay. It's okay. It's okay.
[02:50.29](Crying Continues)
[02:52.92](Whispers) Cam! (Mutters) Leave me alone.
[02:55.25]There's a- There's a man in Lily's room. Huh?
[02:58.09]There's a man in Lily's room!
[03:03.10]It's go time.
[03:11.77]Oh, thank God.
[03:14.77](Yells) It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.
[03:16.94]She's fine. We must have just heard a neighbor with the same monitor.
[03:20.15]Thank God.
[03:21.99]Boy, if a spider would have broken in here, he would have been in trouble.
[03:25.74](Mouths Words)
[03:29.46](Man) â™?Hey, hey â™?
[03:31.46]â™?Hey, hey Hey, hey â™?
[03:35.54]â™?Hey, hey Hey â™ªâ™ª
[03:42.59]Light-up barbecue tongs.
[03:44.30]This was the lame gift I got Phil.
[03:46.56]- So, was I bummed to get up at 5:00 and wait in line? - (Alarm Beeping)
[03:51.14]No. No, because I was finally getting my husband something that he really, really wanted.
[03:56.48]I was every bit as excited as he was.
[04:00.15](Exhales)
[04:05.74]Uh- No.
[04:09.58](Muttering)
[04:14.96](Snoring)
[04:18.50]Hey, buddy. I hope you're not upset about our chess match yesterday.
[04:21.67]Hey, what do you say we play again? I'm good.
[04:24.26]That's the spirit.
[04:26.39]Downloaded this for you. It's kind of a kid's guide to chess.
[04:29.72]No, Jay. I'm good.
[04:31.60]Nah, it's not all dry like that. They have fun with it.
[04:34.52]See, you can color in the little players with your crayons.
[04:37.31]Now you are making me want to play again.
[04:39.19]Now we're lighting a fire. Let me toss this out.
[04:42.07]If you beat me, if that day should ever come, I'll give you-
[04:48.12]- I want your watch. - Wow, you had that loaded up.
[04:52.12]Okay. Game on.
[04:55.79]Now, I want you to go first.
[04:58.67]Now remember, try to open up the middle of the board.
[05:01.96]I'd have moved that guy two spaces.
[05:04.38]More aggressive.
[05:06.68]And you don't want to bring your queen out that quickly.
[05:09.97]See, now you could've protected that with that, but now you're vulnerable-
[05:13.18]Checkmate. Huh? What?
[05:16.73]How'd you do that?
[05:21.57]You will not believe what's going on at Jake and Debbie's house.
[05:24.11]Who? The people on the monitor. They must live nearby.
[05:27.03]So much drama.
[05:28.78]Okay, Jake told Debbie that he had to work late.
[05:31.66]So she called his boss and found out that he didn't. Busted!
[05:35.37]So she spent all morning on the phone crying and crying and crying to her mother...
[05:39.29]and said if Jake has to work "late" one more time, she's filing for divorce.
[05:45.09]Huh.
[05:46.63]That's it? I give you that tasty dish and all you give me is a "Huh"?
[05:49.51]I-I'm s- Cam, I froze last night.
[05:51.89]I froze. I thought Lily was in danger and I froze.
[05:54.89]But not you. No, you sprung right into action.
[05:57.31]You even had the cool "It's go time" line.
[06:00.02]That comes to me naturally. I spent a year as a crossing guard.
[06:02.57]Cam, I mean, what kind of parent am I if I can't even protect my own family, you know?
[06:08.07]J-Just once I would love to be the guy with no fear...
[06:11.08]who can stand up and, I don't know, you know, kick some ass.
[06:14.45]You're so cute when you're angry with your little fists. Just wanna put you in my pocket.
[06:19.75](Footsteps) Think he's coming.
[06:21.79]He's coming? (Gasps) Here he comes.
[06:23.96]- Dad! - (All) Happy birthday!
[06:26.55]You guys! That's awesome.
[06:28.47]Oh, who are these from? (Alex) Cam and Mitchell.
[06:31.64]Those guys are a class act.
[06:33.22]We're making you breakfast. Uh-huh.
[06:35.06]French waffle cakes.
[06:36.89]Let me guess: One waffle in between two pieces of French toast wrapped in a pancake.
[06:42.15]Nailed it.
[06:43.94]Bring it in here, monkeys.
[06:46.19]Love you! Get over here!
[06:48.49]Good enough.
[06:50.07](Luke) Where's Mom?
[06:51.66]You mean the greatest woman in the world?
[06:53.74]She is standing in line at the Apple Store, making all my birthday wishes come true.
[06:57.54]Aww! Let's see how these bad boys taste.
[06:59.54]Oh, no- Son of a- Oh!
[07:01.13](Clattering) It's hot!
[07:02.67](Luke) Are you okay? (Phil) Fresh out of the oven? That isâ€?
[07:05.25]Do you want some ice? Yes.
[07:07.01]Oh, man! This- (Ice Rattling)
[07:09.68]Oh, that feels better. That feels better. (Haley) Sorry, Dad.
[07:12.39]No, it actually- That feels weird. That burns in a different way!
[07:15.76]Ow! Oh! Don't wash this until we see if I can get my skin back. Okay?
[07:25.15]Let me see it!
[07:26.73]No! Your party's not until tonight. You're just gonna have to wait.
[07:28.86]Just let me see the bag. Did you leave it in the car?
[07:31.24]Yeah! Hey, who'd you deal with?
[07:32.82]Was it a guy named Mehar? They call him "the beast." Oh-
[07:35.24]He's a tiny guy. He must move a ton of product. No.
[07:37.83]I kinda love that you're making me wait.
[07:39.41](Laughs) You are the best wife ever!
[07:41.71]You are the best wife ever!
[07:44.21]I didn't get you the iPad.
[07:46.38]I got to the store and they were all out. I'm so sorry.
[07:50.01]I don't understand. My online buddies got it.
[07:51.93]SAT800 and Brobot didn't get there until 8:00.
[07:55.05]And you definitely got there before they did, because you got there at 6:30.
[07:58.02]No, no, no! You didn't get there at 6:30? Where were you?
[08:00.73]I set the alarm for 5:00. I got up, I came downstairs, I fell asleep.
[08:04.19]No! Oh, my goodness. What have I done? What have I done?
[08:08.65]I should've done this myself. Sweetie, you know what? They're gonna get more in next week.
[08:12.07]Next week? That's the worst thing you can say to an early adopter.
[08:15.57]Where are you going? To a place where birthdays still mean something.
[08:20.08](Door Closes)
[08:27.46](Doorbell Rings) (Manny) I'll get that.
[08:31.55]Hi, Manny. Mitchell?
[08:33.22]What are you doing here at... 4: 17 on a Saturday afternoon?
[08:37.47]Oh, I'm just returning my dad's belt of tools, so-
[08:40.47]At 4: 17 on a Saturday afternoon?
[08:42.69]Don't you have something better to do?
[08:45.19](Chuckles) Hey.
[08:47.36]So, were you a big hit? What do you mean?
[08:49.69]Well, I just assumed there was some kind of costume party. Was Cam the Indian?
[08:53.28]No. For your information, Dad, we were actually doing a little construction at the house.
[08:57.07]Ah. What'd you build? A gift-wrapping station.
[09:00.16]And we're back. So, thank you for that.
[09:03.12]You're welcome.
[09:05.29]Hey, uh, Dad, do you remember when I was, uh, probably 11...
[09:08.29]and you were teaching me how to fight, and then I quit?
[09:10.63]Yeah, when you said everything you needed to learn you'd learn from West Side Story.
[09:14.05]Yeah. How'd that work out for you?
[09:15.80]If I'm ever in a dance fight, I'll let you know. (Both Laughing)
[09:19.22]So, yeah- Is-Is the offer, uh, still good?
[09:22.85]Why? What's the matter? You got problems with Cam?
[09:24.94]No! Wh-Why would you say that?
[09:27.52]Well, come on. I mean, you know, sharing a room with a guy?
[09:30.73]I bunked with my brother. I know that can get pretty rough.
[09:33.28]I don't "bunk" with Cam.
[09:35.07]Dad, I just wanna learn a little self-defense, you know. Show me what you remember.
[09:38.74]Right- Right now? Yeah.
[09:41.74]Okay, uh- Gosh, uh- Thumbs out.
[09:45.79]Thumbs. That a boy. And then-
[09:53.96]That wasn't- That wasn't very pretty, was it?
[09:55.67]You know what? Maybe it was a little too pretty. That's the thing.
[09:59.68]Here it goes.
[10:02.06]Oh! (Groaning) Oh, man!
[10:03.72]Buddy! Think the problem is, you're not jumping from high enough.
[10:07.73]You should get on top of the garage.
[10:09.98]Alex, stop trying to kill your brother.
[10:11.98]Listen, guys, I need your help. We've gotta find your dad one of those iPad thingies.
[10:15.11]So, Haley, text everyone you know.
[10:17.36]Alex? Facebook, chat, tweet, buzz, bling, I don't know! Just do what you have to do.
[10:21.62]We have got to find one of these iPads. Okay? (Gas Hissing)
[10:24.12]Luke? Sweetie, that means stay out of everyone's way and stop inhaling the balloons.
[10:27.83](Squeaky Voice) I'm not inhaling them.
[10:29.88]Stop lying.
[10:33.05]How did she know?
[10:36.59]Didn't your mama teach you never to take a ride from a stranger?
[10:41.43]Got a little vacation time coming up?
[10:43.22]Have fun on the moon!
[10:45.27]Not feeling too well lately?
[10:47.43]Maybe you should come see the doctor...
[10:49.98]and I'll get rid of it!
[10:51.98](Laughs)
[10:54.07]What's that supposed to mean?
[10:57.61](Woman On P.A.) Attention. If you're here for Phil's birthday party,
[11:00.91]they're gathering in the picnic area.
[11:02.95]Phil's birthday party.
[11:04.95]My wife knew I'd be here. She put together a whole party for me.
[11:08.58]Does that really make up for not getting an iPad?
[11:11.08]Don't make me sorry I shared that with you. Okay?
[11:14.34]See you, fellas.
[11:20.26]Howdy-do!
[11:21.93]I just heard the announcement for Phil's birthday party.
[11:24.93]Oh, yeah. It's right around the corner.
[11:26.93]Awesome. Have fun!
[11:28.60]Thank you. Thanks, milady. (Chuckles)
[11:30.98](Clears Throat)
[11:33.15](Chattering)
[11:36.15]Ice cream cake? Ice cream cake's good.
[11:39.11](All Shouting) Happy birthday, Phil!
[11:42.49]Whoa- This is awesome!
[11:45.03](Voices Overlapping) Happy birthday! Happy birthday!
[11:51.25](Woman) Happy birthday, sweetie.
[11:52.79](Child) Happy birthday. Have a really good birthday.
[11:54.46](Woman #2) Did you see the cake? (Man) Oh, yeah. It's great.
[11:56.96](Phone Ringing On Baby Monitor)
[11:59.09](Jake) Hello?
[12:00.84]No, that's fine, I'm just putting the baby down.
[12:03.01]Okay, that's Jake. He's the one that's having an affair.
[12:05.64]I know. (Jake) Yeah, I can do it tomorrow night.
[12:08.81]I'll just give my wife some excuse.
[12:10.64](Sighs) Men are pigs.
[12:13.10]- I don't really have a choice, do I? - Yeah.
[12:15.48]You could not cheat on her! How about that?
[12:17.23]Because it has to be a surprise.
[12:18.82]When she hears me speaking Italian to her grandmother,
[12:21.82]it'll be worth all this sneaking around.
[12:23.82]Lily, I had it backwards. He's wonderful.
[12:25.82]- Don't worry. I'll just tell her I'm working late. - No, Jake, don't do that.
[12:28.83]That's the worst thing you could do.
[12:30.45]Buona notte. (Phone Beeps)
[12:32.00]Oh, no, Lily, what are we gonna do? We have to fix this.
[12:37.59]Okay, Mitchell, I'm gonna teach you a couple of basic Brazilian jiu-jitsu moves.
[12:41.80]Now, just- just attack me.
[12:43.84]I'm sorry- What?
[12:45.55]Take any deep-seated anger you may have, get a running start and come at me.
[12:49.01]Dad, I don't have any deep-seated anger.
[12:50.68]Remember that Halloween when I wouldn't let you go as Olivia Newton-John?
[12:53.27](Yells)
[12:54.52](Grunts, Gasps)
[12:55.85]You see what I did? I used your momentum against you.
[12:58.52]I learned this choke from the Gracie brothers.
[13:00.11]It's called the lion killer- mata leÃ£o.
[13:03.65]Okay. Now try to get out. Try to get out. See?
[13:06.66]I can't. Yeah, all right. Now-
[13:08.70]Passing out- See, the beauty of this is,
[13:10.37]you don't have to make the first move.
[13:12.29]You know, chances are your opponent's gonna be overconfident.
[13:15.04]He's gonna think you don't know anything.
[13:17.04]Basically, he's being suckered into thinking-
[13:19.42]Manny. Manny, that little bastard, he hustled me.
[13:24.47]Oh, crap.
[13:26.64]Ah, crap. Mitchell!
[13:30.14]Oh, crap. All right. Come on. Breathe.
[13:33.73]Attaboy. You all right? Coming around. (Groaning)
[13:36.44]Why am I on the floor? Come on, Mitchell.
[13:38.52](Phone Ringing)
[13:41.53]Haley, I just struck out again. Please tell me you have some good news.
[13:45.07]Okay, so The Grove just got a new shipment. I'm texting you the directions now.
[13:48.07]Oh! Okay, that's good. That's good. That's good.
[13:52.95]I'm there. I'm on that.
[13:59.21]That kid stole my watch.
[14:00.75]Huh? What?
[14:02.34]He hustled me at chess.
[14:04.13](Exhales) I thought you promised you were gonna let him win.
[14:06.55]- I did the first time. - Wait a minute. You're in on it too?
[14:09.55]- Manny, go and get dressed for the party. - Do I have time for a steam?
[14:12.85]- Yeah, but a quick one. - Okay.
[14:14.85]Why tell him to lose to me? Because you're like a baby when you don't win.
[14:18.27]With the kicking and the eyebrows...
[14:20.36]and the angry eating of the sunflower seeds. (Chittering)
[14:23.57]Actually, that's not true.
[14:25.24]I don't mind losing to a chess genius, which Manny obviously is.
[14:28.66]Chess genius? He's not even as good as I am.
[14:31.07]You're not that good in chess. I beat you on our honeymoon. Or did I let you win?
[14:34.62]You didn't let me win.
[14:37.12]Why would I sacrifice my queen for your pawn, Jay?
[14:40.71]Huh? Huh?
[14:46.67]Huh? Stop saying that.
[14:50.64](Phone Ringing)
[14:54.39](Beeps) Luke, honey, hi. What's going on?
[14:57.39]They guy came with Dad's cake, but just so you know, it's missing a piece.
[15:01.27]Luke, did you take a bite out of your father's cake? No.
[15:04.44]Stop lying, Luke. I'm not lying.
[15:06.99]By the way, I used your credit card to pay him. Is that all right?
[15:10.28]Oh, no, that's fine. Whatever.
[15:12.91]That's why I left the wallet there.
[15:15.87]Oh, my God.
[15:18.50]Oh, my God!
[15:20.50]I left the wallet there! I left the wa- Your poor father.
[15:24.13]All this running around, and he's gonna think nobody cares about him on his birthday.
[15:27.63]More cake?
[15:29.51]Why not, Little Phil?
[15:31.47]I got no place else to go.
[15:33.51](Chattering)
[15:43.27]Sir! Sir! Sir, hi. Excuse me.
[15:46.53]Um, yes. I know this is highly unusual,
[15:49.53]but I need your help to save a marriage.
[15:52.36]There is a couple in this neighborhood...
[15:54.16]that is about to get a divorce for a simple misunderstanding.
[15:56.62]Their name is Jake and Debbie.
[15:58.29]And I know you've taken an oath...
[16:00.29]to not tell people where other people live, and I respect that,
[16:03.04]but maybe we could work out some sort of super secretive spy signal,
[16:06.17]where if you scratch your left ear, you know, maybe they live on the left,
[16:09.01]and if you scratch your right ear, they live on-
[16:11.05]They live right here.
[16:13.09]Oh.
[16:15.68]This conversation never happened.
[16:21.73]Sorry. Oh, thank God!
[16:23.35]Oh, thank you. Thank you.
[16:25.36]Dad just put me to sleep. Oh, the hunting story.
[16:28.36]Hmm. No.
[16:30.07]Oh, my gosh, no. You can't cut the line. Sorry.
[16:32.82]I was here. Uh-uh.
[16:34.57]I-I've been here for an hour and a half and you haven't been, so you cut the line.
[16:38.87]Whatever. Whoa. Excuse me, sir.
[16:40.87]I don't think you understand. You're not getting in front of us.
[16:43.87]Calm down, gingerbread.
[16:46.59]- Are you gonna move or not? - No.
[16:49.34]Oh, no.
[16:51.34]Then you leave me no choice.
[16:53.76]Oh, my God. Go to sleep.
[16:57.26]Go to sleep. Go to sleep. No.
[17:00.22]Mitchell, what are you doing? Get off of him. Shut up.
[17:02.98]He's about to go to sleep. No, I'm not.
[17:04.98]Okay, folks. Let's break this up. You three- out of line.
[17:07.06]Oh, no. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't have anything to do with this.
[17:09.44]I'm just waiting in line to get an iPad. I don't even know this guy.
[17:12.74]Oh, my God. I need your credit card.
[17:14.28]He's the problem. Shut up! You're supposed to be asleep.
[17:16.16]It's okay. I have it. Get off!
[17:17.74]I've got it. What?
[17:19.28]I've got your card. I'm good. No, I'm good.
[17:21.45]I'm good. I'm here. I'm here!
[17:23.46]I've gotta get my husband an iPad!
[17:26.00]Key to a good birthday? Low expectations.
[17:29.59]Thought I was getting an iPad. I was wrong about that.
[17:32.84]Thought I was getting a surprise party at the batting cages. Sorry, Big Phil.
[17:36.30](Laughs)
[17:38.26]Guess when it comes right down to it,
[17:39.80]we're all just Jeff Sweeney taking a fastball to the plums.
[17:46.94]Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter,
[17:49.44]but Uncle Cam's trying to fix it.
[17:51.61]He won't.
[17:53.61]And the pizzas never showed up.
[17:55.61]And they won't!
[17:57.61]Hey, balloons.
[17:59.62]Fine. I guess we'll never know. Or we can find out right now.
[18:02.45]Yeah, Manny, give me the chess set.
[18:04.45]- Oh, it's a chess set. - Yeah. You'll get it later. We got something to settle now.
[18:07.67]Go in there. Happy birthday, Phil.
[18:09.88]Happy happy.
[18:11.34]Is that Claire's baked Brie I smell? (Laughs)
[18:14.05]No.
[18:17.01]Oh, Cam, Cam, you'll never believe what happened.
[18:19.93]Happy birthday, Phil! Sure!
[18:22.18]You'll never believe what happened. I got in trouble for fighting.
[18:24.35](Gasps) And we saved a marriage.
[18:26.23]Well, this is the best day ever. It really is.
[18:28.65]Ain't it though?
[18:31.69](Clears Throat)
[18:33.32]Look at this, papi, huh?
[18:36.28](Laughing) Easy.
[18:38.61]You can't sing "We Are the Champions"...
[18:41.49]without your queen.
[18:43.24]Damn it! Listen, I lose and I burn this house down!
[18:49.50]Ah, but look at this- Honey, honey.
[18:51.42]What are we doing? This is ridiculous.
[18:54.21]One of us is gonna win the game, the other's gonna feel lousy, and we both lose.
[19:01.68]Yeah, just leave my birthday present on the floor.
[19:04.01]That's my girl. (Jay) She had me.
[19:06.02]There was no way I could win. I knew it. I'm just glad she didn't know it yet.
[19:10.56]Two moves, and then- (Cutting Sound)
[19:13.06]I'm a very good chess player.
[19:14.90]But I'm a better wife.
[19:19.24]Hey, did you get it? No.
[19:21.24]How's your dad? Acting weird... er.
[19:24.74]Hey, wife. Honey, hi.
[19:26.75]Um, listen- Mom.
[19:28.75]Yeah, Luke, hang on one second.
[19:30.75]Honey, it's okay. I don't feel things anymore.
[19:33.75]But, sweetie, I want you to feel- Mom!
[19:35.46]Luke, I'll be with you in just a second. Where are you going?
[19:38.26]Just heading out to the yard to get a shovel for my cake. Mom.
[19:41.26]- Luke, what do you want? - I went on Dad's computer,
[19:44.47]contacted some of his geek friends,
[19:46.64]told them that he was dying and his last wish was an iPad.
[19:50.52]Luke, what have I told you about-
[19:52.56]One of them felt so bad, they brought over an extra.
[19:55.57]Oh, my God. You got it. You beautiful little liar!
[19:59.57](Door Opens) Here comes Dad.
[20:05.49](Chattering)
[20:08.91]Who wants some cake?
[20:11.75]I used to, but I don't desire food any-
[20:14.67]Oh, my God. You got it!
[20:16.25]All this time I said I didn't care, but I do care. I care so much!
[20:19.51]Do you want to blow out the candles? Yes.
[20:21.88]Go on. Go. (Blowing)
[20:23.93]It did not just do that!
[20:26.30]Yes, it did! Honey!
[20:29.06]Oh, who's ready for the first day of the rest of their lives?
[20:32.89]Phil, happy birthday! Look at this!
[20:35.19]Can I touch it? Yeah, not so hard, but touch it.
[20:38.65]Touch it, but don't touch it. Touch it, but don't touch it.
[20:44.82](Debbie) I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.
[20:47.08]I love you. (Jake) Thank God that guy came over.
[20:49.54]What did he say his name was? He didn't. Must be an angel.
[20:53.58]Did you hear that? I'm an angel.
[20:55.17](Jake) Or some creepy perv. Yeah.
[20:57.54]Wow. How did he know? Eww.
[21:02.05](Jake) Maybe I should call the police. You should call the police.
[21:04.84]I'm gonna call the police. And they lived happily ever after.
[21:07.97]No, Cam. Where are you going? It was just getting good.
[21:10.27]I want- That's my program.
[21:13.94]I love you.
[21:15.52]I love you too, honey. Oh. Okay.
