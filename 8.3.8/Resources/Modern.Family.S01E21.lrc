[00:01.83](Rings)
[00:04.58]Honeydew! What's up?
[00:06.92]Guess who's here. Your dad!
[00:09.71](Chuckles) He drove his R.V. All the way up from Cocoa Beach.
[00:13.47]Hey, Son, working hard?
[00:15.89]He's gonna say "Hardly working." (Chuckles)
[00:17.97]I meant to tell you he was driving out.
[00:20.98]Did he say it? Oh, yeah.
[00:22.81]- Good kid. - He wasn't supposed to show up for a few more days.
[00:26.27]Well, guess what he brought us.
[00:29.03]A dog... to keep.
[00:31.69]Yes! Yes.
[00:33.95]Yes, I should have told Claire about the dog, and I was going to.
[00:38.24]But I was just waiting for her to be in the right mood.
[00:42.87]Actually, I did get one right mood a couple nights ago,
[00:45.08]but I cashed that in for something else.
[00:48.67]- Am I in trouble? - Oh, really, really big.
[00:53.51]Okay, I'm a little scared. How bad is this? Oh, well-
[00:56.22]We have a new rule- no sleeping in the bedroom. (Chuckles)
[01:04.64]Mr. Pritchett. Uh, Ben- Ben Dugan.
[01:07.90]I went to high school with Mitch. We were in the drama club together.
[01:10.44]That's right. Yeah.
[01:12.24]Geez, I didn't recognize you without that old-guy makeup on.
[01:14.82]You know, you and Mitch knocked The Sunshine Boys out of the park.
[01:17.53]Mitch was really great in that. I always thought he should be an actor.
[01:20.53]Yeah, he's got a real job now. He's a lawyer. How about you?
[01:23.37]Still acting. Fantastic.
[01:26.21]Actually, it's exciting. I'm in a new movie, Maple Drive. Just came out.
[01:29.13]You're kidding me. Look at me. I know somebody famous.
[01:31.67]Uh, anyway, I got to go.
[01:33.92]Great to see you. Good to see you too. Yeah.
[01:36.63]Kid's a movie star.
[01:39.18]Hey, how'd it go in there? No cavities.
[01:41.18]And I got a free toothbrush. Hey, you want to go to the movies?
[01:44.18]I just heard about a good one. But I'm supposed to be in school.
[01:46.81]Well, you're supposed to floss too, but you got away with that one.
[01:49.19]Come on. Let's go.
[01:51.23](Jay) One of the greatest days of my life...
[01:53.23]was when my old man sprung me from school and took me to the track.
[01:57.07]I wanted to do the same type of thing for Manny,
[01:59.37]plus I figured when Gloria heard about it, maybe it pays off in the bedroom.
[02:04.79]I wonder if that's why my old man did it.
[02:07.83]Oh, crap.
[02:09.83](Dad) Your mother-in-law just had to have the dog.
[02:12.46]Turns out she's allergic.
[02:14.59]And the pet store didn't have a grace period or a return policy or anything?
[02:18.55]I got him from the pound.
[02:20.51]Was there a twister in Kansas? 'Cause there's a house in my driveway.
[02:25.14]Welcome home, Mr. Dunphy. Uh, always a pleasure, Mr. Dunphy.
[02:28.73]Indeed it is, Mr. Dunphy. Place it there.
[02:32.48]- Oh, I shall. I shall. - I miss this. Get in here.
[02:35.69](Phil) My dad is awesome.
[02:37.24]He's awesome. He's always up. He's always happy.
[02:40.57]I mean, he and I are best buds. We're like two peas in a pod.
[02:43.91]Or Siamese twins. Or a snake with two heads.
[02:47.54]They've actually been all those things for Halloween. Yeah.
[02:50.54]Oy. This must be Scout, huh?
[02:52.96]I should warn you. He sheds. I made the mistake of letting him sleep with me on the road.
[02:56.76]Now my sheets look like two bigfoots did it. Pardon the language.
[03:00.22](Chuckles) How's Mom? Speaking of big feet, eh?
[03:03.55]She's on a cruise with her girlfriends,
[03:05.85]some of which are not totally unattractive.
[03:07.89]Oh, that reminds me. She sent some gifts for the kids.
[03:11.15]Um, I will be right back.
[03:13.15]- You three get better acquainted. - Will do!
[03:16.19]Bye! Will do!
[03:17.78]I cannot believe you got a dog without consulting me.
[03:20.53]This was a major family decision.
[03:22.70]It was wrong. Yeah.
[03:24.28]And I'm sorry. Mmm.
[03:25.53]But we have talked about getting a dog for years,
[03:27.62]and you're the only one who wasn't into it.
[03:29.37]Because I knew that I would be the one taking care of it.
[03:31.79]That's not true. Uh-
[03:33.38]No, we will all help. Mm-hmm?
[03:35.80]This is a great chance to teach the kids responsibility.
[03:39.47]That is exactly what you said about Luke's paper route.
[03:48.93](Man) â™?Hey, hey â™?
[03:50.98]â™?Hey, hey Hey, hey â™?
[03:55.15]â™?Hey, hey Hey â™ªâ™ª
[04:01.40]Hello? â™ªâ™ª (Suspenseful)
[04:04.37]Is anyone in there?
[04:10.66](Gasps)
[04:16.17](Breathing Heavily)
[04:18.96]Red's a good color on you.
[04:21.34](Screaming)
[04:23.68](Whimpers) (Knife Slashing)
[04:26.14]It's just a movie.
[04:28.14](Haley) Oh, he's so cute.
[04:30.14]Look at his little face. I always wanted a dog. Thanks, Grandpa.
[04:35.06]Okay, but remember, having a dog is a major responsibility.
[04:37.36]Everyone in the family has to pitch in.
[04:39.61]- Can do, Mrs. D. - Not you, Dylan.
[04:42.70]Oh, phew. 'Cause I got a lot on my plate right now.
[04:44.86](Phil) Hey, look who's here. Uncle Cam.
[04:47.20]Hey, we heard about the new addition and we had to come right over.
[04:50.58]Cameron, so good to see you again. Now that is a shirt.
[04:54.79]Oh, well, thank you, Frank. I get 'em online. I'll send you a link.
[04:57.46]Oh, well, at home, I smoke sausages. I'll send you a link.
[05:00.50](Laughs) Classic.
[05:02.21]And this must be Lily. Oh, yes.
[05:05.01]Aww! She just couldn't wait to meet the new doggy.
[05:06.89]I think she's good right here. Let me get in there and get some of that doggyness.
[05:10.93]Oh, there it is. Haley.
[05:13.43]There it is. I gotta go.
[05:15.10]What's wrong? That was Brian. He just quit the band.
[05:18.23]What? Why? He's moving to Portland. His parents got back together.
[05:22.57]Oh, that sucks. I know.
[05:24.57](Dylan) Now we're gonna have to cancel the gig tomorrow.
[05:26.95]Maybe you can find another drummer.
[05:28.95]No. I think it's too late for that now.
[05:31.24]I play drums.
[05:32.95]Huh? Well, I mean, I haven't played in a while,
[05:35.66]since Lily's come along, but if you're in a jam, I can jam.
[05:40.79]Well, I totally would, but I'm not sure we like the same sorts of music, you know?
[05:45.01]What, because I'm gay, I'm just gonna want to play show tunes?
[05:47.09]No, because you're old.
[05:50.43]Wow. That hurt more, Dylan.
[05:52.47]Give him a chance. It's better than canceling.
[05:55.10]You're right. I don't want to lose the deposit on that fog machine.
[05:59.23]Okay. Let's do it.
[06:01.27]I used to be a music teacher, but I gave that up as soon as Lily came along.
[06:04.57]Yes. Well, we just felt that it was really important...
[06:06.65]that one of us stayed home to raise her, so-
[06:08.70]Yeah, and that's not a judgment on other people's choices.
[06:10.82]It's just that we happen to be a very traditional family. Mm-hmm.
[06:15.41]Yes, that's what the disabled lesbian shaman who blessed Lily's room said too.
[06:24.80]How you doin', buddy? (Whimpers)
[06:26.80]All right, relax.
[06:31.18](Sobbing)
[06:37.35](Wailing)
[06:44.15]Oh, geez.
[06:51.20]I am telling you, Phil, the man was crying.
[06:54.20]That is impossible. My dad is the happiest guy on earth.
[06:56.50]It probably just sounded like he was crying.
[06:58.21]Have you heard the noise he makes when he gets out of a chair?
[07:00.96]No. I know what I heard. I think this has something to do with your mom.
[07:04.21]What? Yeah, he came here alone. Think about it.
[07:07.09]She's on a cruise. Yeah, and they never take separate vacations, so-
[07:12.34]No. No, if something was wrong, my dad would tell me about it.
[07:15.22]No, Phil, he wouldn't, because you guys never actually talk about anything.
[07:18.48]We talk all the time. He crank calls me at work, like, three times a week.
[07:21.52]Crank calls don't count. Counts for fun.
[07:23.52]No, honestly, I think that you should find out what's going on with your dad.
[07:27.48]It's going to be nothing. My dad isn't like your dad.
[07:31.53]There's nothing deep and dark inside.
[07:33.70]His hard candy shell is just hiding more candy.
[07:37.16]- (Scout Barks) - I think he wants to go out. Good boy.
[07:41.29]Smart dog. I hate to break it to you, but I think all dogs can do that.
[07:45.79]I'm gonna play outside.
[07:47.38]- (Crash) - Ow!
[07:50.01]Uh! What happened?
[07:53.05](Cameron) Okay.
[07:55.05]Should I just play a little something?
[07:57.47]Yeah. But, you know, if it doesn't work out, don't feel bad.
[08:00.93]Well, hopefully this is- this is like riding a bicycle,
[08:05.15]and it'll all come back to me.
[08:07.69]That's the loud one. â™ªâ™ª (Bass Drum)
[08:10.40]So... here we go.
[08:28.71]Hmm.
[08:30.71]Oh, silly me.
[08:32.84]I had the sticks in the wrong hands.
[08:52.53]Wow.
[08:54.41]Dude, you should label those sticks.
[08:57.57](Clicks Tongue)
[08:59.24](Doorbell Ringing)
[09:01.58](Ringing Continues)
[09:03.66]Is that the alarm? Has our perimeter been breached?
[09:06.38]It's not the alarm. The doorbell won't stop ringing.
[09:09.13]Maybe a demon is ringing it. Not a demon.
[09:11.05]the doorbell? Â¡Ay! Who keeps ringing
[09:14.34]We're pretty sure it's a demon. Oh, yeah?
[09:17.18](Ringing Stops) (Grunts) There.
[09:18.93]If it were a demon, it would keep on ringing.
[09:20.97]Not if he's already inside. I'm getting a weapon.
[09:24.27]What were you thinking?
[09:26.60]Who takes a little boy to a horror movie? That's loco, Jay.
[09:29.73]This is no big deal. You want scary?
[09:31.90]When I was his age, I lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[09:35.11]I slept with a butter knife under my pillow...
[09:37.32]in case I had to fight some Soviet colonel.
[09:39.95]Why would they send a Soviet colonel to get a little boy?
[09:43.16]Because I could identify every commie plane.
[09:45.83]What are we talking about?
[09:48.04]Look, all I'm saying, being scared is part of growing up.
[09:50.34]Manny will get over this. It builds character.
[09:54.47]I'll take the first watch. You two might as well get some rest.
[09:58.68]It's gonna be a long night.
[10:02.81]Character.
[10:06.27]Dad?
[10:07.85]Come on in! It's open! Hey!
[10:10.19]Ah, don't tell me. You need a cup of sugar.
[10:12.65](Chuckles) Nah. Just, uh-
[10:15.49]I was just wondering, I don't know, uh-
[10:19.70]Anything on the old noodle?
[10:21.45]Other than a bad toupee? I'm kidding, of course. This is my real hair.
[10:25.20]Well, okay. Wait a minute. I want to ask you something.
[10:28.71]Am I putting you in a bad position with this whole dog thing?
[10:32.13]Claire seemed a little put out. Oh, don't worry about it.
[10:35.34]Claire didn't like me at first either. I can't blame her. Dismissed!
[10:39.93](Chuckles) Oh, Dad, um, you know what? I, uh-
[10:44.22]Claire saw something, and she'd kill me if I- if I didn't ask.
[10:48.56]What is it?
[10:54.11]Would you wear pants to breakfast, for crying out loud?
[10:58.03]You got me again. Right in the funny bone. All right.
[11:00.99]Come on, Scout. Let go of it. (Growling)
[11:03.12]No, no, no! Oh!
[11:05.37]Dog. Look at this.
[11:07.58]How did he get ahold of your bra?
[11:09.92]Well, uh, we were out on a date, and he has a really nice car, so-
[11:13.09]How do you think? He got it out of the laundry basket.
[11:15.55]Can't take my eyes off that dog for a second.
[11:17.84]- Why don't you just keep him in the crate? - I tried that.
[11:20.38]He figured out how to get out. I thought you were dealing with your dad.
[11:23.55]Oh, yeah, I did. He's fine, so-
[11:25.60]Whoa! You got that from a two-minute conversation?
[11:29.06]I... asked him point-blank if he was okay. He said he was. So I just-
[11:34.19]Just swapped some jokes and moved on.
[11:37.48]Phil, the man needs more of a push than that.
[11:39.95]Look, if he wants to talk to me about it, he will.
[11:44.03]Geez, someone's panties are in a bunch.
[11:46.03]I thought I was showing concern and- No. Right there.
[11:48.83]Oh, my God! That damn dog!
[11:51.96]Guys, little help?
[11:54.79]I have to go to the bathroom, and I'm not gonna do it in here.
[12:00.63]â™ªâ™ª (Drumming)
[12:06.18]- Hey, I got Chinese. - Sweet! I'm starving.
[12:10.52]- Oh, we have guests. - Yeah. Hey. We're just having a little jam session.
[12:14.86]You know Dylan. This is Craig. This is Neil.
[12:17.90]I'll always remember him as the stranger holding my baby.
[12:20.32]Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?
[12:22.86]Yeah. Hey, guys, let's, uh- let's just take five.
[12:26.20]What's up with 21 Jump Street?
[12:28.33]Oh, well, their drummer quit and I'm gonna fill in for him tomorrow night.
[12:31.50]No, no. We have Pepper's tomorrow night, Cam. aprÃ¨s-ski fondue party
[12:34.71]Oh, no.
[12:36.71]So you'll just have to tell your band that they're gonna have to find someone else.
[12:39.76]You know what? No. I'm not gonna let these fellas down. I made a commitment.
[12:42.80]You made two commitments, okay?
[12:44.84]And you know how Pepper is. Everything has to be perfect.
[12:47.35]He gets mad if you don't wear a big sweater.
[12:49.60]Yeah, I remember. I got so hot last year, I almost went face down in the gruyÃ¨re.
[12:52.85]So I'm going by myself, is that what you're saying?
[12:54.94](Exhales) I just feel like I kind of need this.
[12:57.69]To round out your college applications?
[13:00.48]It's just that because I'm always home with Lily...
[13:03.20]I just feel like I'm going a little bit stir-crazy.
[13:05.53]Look at the den. Every time I finish painting it, I start all over again.
[13:08.45]It's like the Golden Gate Bridge.
[13:11.37]I'm gonna go back to jamming.
[13:17.17](Grunts, Screams)
[13:21.05]Yeah, we gotta fix this. Ay.
[13:26.97](Chattering) â™ªâ™ª (Speakers: Rock)
[13:33.06]Hey, what's with the big sweater at a concert? Is that a gay thing?
[13:36.19]No, Dad. It's for my friend Pepper's aprÃ¨s-ski fondue-
[13:39.86]Yeah. Yeah, it's a gay thing.
[13:42.32]Hope they start soon. I don't think Scout likes to be left alone.
[13:47.24]You love the dog.
[13:49.07]No, I don't love the dog. I love my couch.
[13:51.37]And the dog was looking at it like it was a giant sausage.
[13:54.41]Good news, you two. You're getting your driveway back.
[13:56.71]I'm hitting the open road in the morning. Oh, already?
[13:59.38]Yeah. Anxious to get home and see Mom, huh?
[14:01.34]No, I'm just gonna drive wherever the wind blows me,
[14:03.34]which is usually into the next lane.
[14:05.13](Alex) Can we get some sodas, Grandpa?
[14:07.13]Okay, but just one. I'm driving. Come on. (Alex Chuckles)
[14:11.76]He's not going home? He's never been away from my mom for longer than a doctor's appointment.
[14:15.73]Honey, I know. I told you.
[14:17.73]I always felt bad for people with emotionally distant fathers.
[14:20.06]It turns out I'm one of 'em.
[14:21.61]It's a miracle I didn't end up a stripper.
[14:24.99]Hey. Thanks, everybody, for coming out.
[14:26.99]These are some songs we wrote.
[14:29.03]One, two. One, two, three.
[14:32.41]â™?Baby, don't leave me I just want you to know â™?
[14:37.04]â™?I want you to know â™?
[14:39.29]â™?There's something inside me that I cannot control â™?
[14:43.25]â™?I cannot control â™?
[14:45.26]Our boyfriends totally rock! I know, right?
[14:48.09]â™?I heard you screamin' my name I'm goin' insane â™?
[14:50.14]Well, the plan was...
[14:51.93]to watch him for 10 minutes and then run out to Pepper's party.
[14:54.93]â™?Coursing through my veins â™?
[14:57.77]But he was so great up there.
[15:00.85]How-How could I leave?
[15:02.52]- Whoo-hoo! - â™?Afraid But don't be afraid â™?
[15:06.99]â™?I'll be your vampire â™?
[15:09.15]It was his moment.
[15:10.74]- Wow! - â™?Come on â™?
[15:13.03]I know!
[15:14.95]â™ªâ™ª (Drum Solo)
[15:26.55]And his moment went on for a really, really long time.
[15:37.18]â™ªâ™ª (Continues)
[15:43.44](Drumstick Clatters)
[15:47.98]Turns out I could have run to the party and made it back for the end of his moment.
[15:53.53]â™ªâ™ª (Ends)
[15:56.91]Manny, go brush your teeth and get ready for bed, okay?
[16:00.04]Your bed. Can I watch TV?
[16:03.46]Mmm, only 10 minutes. Okay.
[16:09.51]We'll speak no more of it now.
[16:13.89](Beeps) Hey, Jay, it's Ben Dugan. I got your message.
[16:17.43]Uh, yes, I'm happy to help out. I'll swing by tonight.
[16:20.23]What's that? That's Ben. That's the guy who was in the movie.
[16:23.56]I figure when Manny sees him, sees how nice he is, he'll realize it's all pretend.
[16:30.49](No Doorbell)
[16:32.82](Gloria) You think that will work? (Jay) Guy's a sweetheart.
[16:35.70]Manny's gonna spend two minutes with him. He'll explain how the movie's made.
[16:38.91]He's even bringing his fake machete. Thing's made of rubber.
[16:46.75]- You mean you wish to train here as a novice? - (Knocking)
[16:49.92]Hey, are you Manny? I'm here for you.
[16:53.97]Look what I got.
[16:56.43](Screaming)
[16:58.10]Mom, he's here!
[17:00.43]Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³? Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³? Â¿QuÃ© pasÃ³?
[17:02.27](Manny Crying)
[17:04.14]Â¡Ay!
[17:06.27]We're gonna need a bigger bed!
[17:08.65](Knocking)
[17:10.23](Jay) Oh, geez.
[17:14.65]Oh, my God! I think that's him.
[17:16.74]Hey. You stayed. Yeah.
[17:19.58]Well, you know, I'm-I'm with the band.
[17:21.58]I thought the gig was a little sloppy in spots,
[17:23.79]but I think once I learn all the songs-
[17:27.29]I thought- I thought this was a one-time thing?
[17:29.92]Are you kidding? We destroyed in there.
[17:31.80]Did you hear that one lady screaming my name?
[17:33.80]That was Phil. He had a Red Bull.
[17:36.97]Hey, guys. Good gig, huh?
[17:39.64]- Yeah. Totally awesome, man. - Heck of a gig.
[17:42.31]Hey, guys. Hey. I thought you were in Portland.
[17:46.02]No. My parents broke up again.
[17:48.73]I'm not moving. I can stay in the band.
[17:51.15](Chuckles) Well, this is awkward.
[17:56.78]Uh- Cam.
[18:00.99]Oh, awkward for me.
[18:07.46]Good luck following that, Ringo.
[18:12.67]I believe this belongs to you.
[18:14.84]I don't want to drag the house along with me. (Chuckles)
[18:17.59]Come here, you little monkeys.
[18:19.39]Bye, Grandpa. We'II miss you.
[18:20.97]I wish I could take you with me.
[18:22.51](Alex) Drive safe, Grandpa. Oh, I'll try.
[18:24.98]You sure you don't want to stay for breakfast?
[18:26.85]No, I ought to be hitting the road.
[18:30.69]Well, adios.
[18:32.36]Dad, hold on. Hmm?
[18:33.94]Can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
[18:36.90](Whispers) Guys. Come on.
[18:39.70]I don't think you're being honest with me.
[18:43.16]I- I know something is going on with you.
[18:46.96]What's up?
[18:48.96]Something up? Well, my boxers are, uh, riding a little high.
[18:52.96]I'm not in the mood for jokes right now, although you nailed that.
[18:55.38]Thanks. Great stuff.
[18:56.92]Thanks.
[18:59.93]It's nothing. Oh, it's nothing?
[19:04.14]Nothing to do with Mom? No!
[19:07.93]Well, yeah. I've fallen in love.
[19:13.06]Oh, my God.
[19:14.90]Who is she? He!
[19:17.36]What?
[19:19.24]It's that little guy right over there.
[19:22.07]Come on over here. Come on.
[19:23.99]Come on. There you go. Ah, look at him.
[19:27.12]Driving across country,
[19:29.08]this little bastard nuzzled his way right into my heart, didn't ya?
[19:33.00]So this is just about you not wanting to leave the dog? Well, you should tell Mom.
[19:36.92]Those three days on the road with him were the happiest of my life.
[19:39.76]You should leave that part out.
[19:41.80]I don't want to keep Scout if it makes Grandpa sad.
[19:44.89]Yeah, I know, sweetie. But Grandma has allergies, so Scout has to stay with us.
[19:49.68]Well, she could always just get some allergy shots.
[19:52.52]Honey, you don't want to put her through that.
[19:54.61]Hell, back in the day, I got a vasectomy for her.
[19:57.48]Dad. Dad. Please.
[20:00.45]Scout's- Scout's your dog.
[20:02.45]He should go with you.
[20:07.41]Okay, you twisted my arm. (Chuckles)
[20:10.71]Thanks, Son. Thanks for poking through the armor.
[20:14.83]You're poking through the armor down there. What?
[20:16.96]Made you look. (Laughs)
[20:18.84]You are a treasure.
[20:20.59]Come on, Scout. Let's mosey.
[20:22.76]Oh, oh, oh! Oh, wait.
[20:27.14]He loves that, yeah. Oh, I bet he does.
[20:29.47]No, Scout. This time I drive.
[20:33.14]You still got it!
[20:36.15]I can't believe I'm saying this,
[20:37.73]but I think I might have actually gotten even closer with my dad.
[20:42.61]I can't believe he took my dog.
[20:45.45]Bye-bye. Bye, Grandpa! Love you!
[20:47.41]Bye, Dad.
[20:48.99]Bye, Grandpa! I love you! (Phil) Luke, stay!
[20:51.62]Luke, stay! Come back soon! I'll see you later!
[20:53.62]Luke, stay!
[20:54.83]Luke! Stay!
[20:59.46]Frank. â™ªâ™ª (Speakers: Rock)
[21:01.76]Hey, Jay. Good to see you.
[21:03.63]Great to see you. Didn't expect to find you here.
[21:06.30]Well, listen, when my granddaughter's boyfriend's band plays an under-21 club...
[21:10.64]with my daughter-in-law's brother's gay partner, I show up.
[21:14.06]That's just how I was raised.
[21:16.02]I don't think you met my wife, Gloria. Hola.
[21:18.86]Oh, it's a pleasure. You are a lovely woman.
[21:22.28]You must be Frank. Okay, then,
[21:25.07]you are hotter than a Las Vegas sidewalk on the Fourth of July.
[21:29.37]Did I go too far? Not you, Frank. No.
