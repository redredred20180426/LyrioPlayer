[00:01.66]What am I most afraid of? Hmm. Let's see.
[00:05.42]Global warming... and getting a "B."
[00:08.50]The phone ringing in the middle of the night.
[00:11.51]That I'm too much of a perfectionist.
[00:14.26]Honey, this isn't a job interview.
[00:16.26]Oh, man.
[00:18.26]Job interviews.
[00:20.27]Nothing. Yeah, right. What about the pigeons?
[00:23.39]Oh, I don't like them. They're shifty.
[00:26.61]Losing Mitchell. Oh!
[00:30.07]Hotel bedspreads. Ooh.
[00:33.07]Never getting my driver's license.
[00:35.11]Or getting one and the picture sucks.
[00:38.83]Dying alone.
[00:40.45]Oh, Haley, sweetie, did you find your shoes?
[00:43.12]Mom, please, not today. I just wanted to know if you found your shoes.
[00:45.88]Why are you hounding me? I'm freaking out right now.
[00:48.71]You need to relax. It's just a driver's test.
[00:51.30]It's my third driver's test, and if I fail again,
[00:54.68]I have to wait six months to retake it.
[00:56.72]That's six more months of you driving me everywhere.
[00:59.56]Then I'm, like, "There's no way I'm wearing that." And she was, like-
[01:02.14]Like. "Well, if you don't wear it, then you can't play."
[01:04.31]And then I was, like, "That's fine by me." Honey, like.
[01:06.40]And then she was, like, "Well, if you don't play-" Like! Like!
[01:08.73]Mom! Stop! Stop saying "like" all the time.
[01:10.48]You're embarrassing me! Stop it! Like, like, like, like, aah!
[01:13.07]Hmm.
[01:14.45]Haley. Found your jacket.
[01:16.78]Why is everyone on me? God!
[01:20.62]Ignore her. She can't focus on two things at once.
[01:23.25]Always a good quality in a driver.
[01:25.83]Sweetie, we need to get you some shoes for the dance tonight.
[01:28.46]No, we don't. I'm not going. What are you talking about?
[01:31.17]Why would you not be going to the dance?
[01:33.13](Exhales) Because school dances are lame.
[01:34.97]A bunch of immature boys trying to impress you with how cool they are...
[01:38.97]when they're really just a bunch of dorks.
[01:41.01](Australian Accent) Ready to go down under, mate?
[01:43.10]Yes.
[01:44.89]- What are you doing? - (Together) Treasure hunting.
[01:48.40]Wow.
[01:49.86]A few days ago, the cable guy was under the house.
[01:52.19]When he was leaving, he said to Haley,
[01:54.53]"Wow. That's quite a collection you've got down there."
[01:57.70]Here's the thing. We have no idea what he's talking about.
[02:02.12]All week, Luke and I have been getting more and more excited about what it could be.
[02:06.00]I bet it's really cool old magazines.
[02:08.87]Yeah. Or a bunch of necklaces made out of animal teeth.
[02:12.75]Or bugs frozen in amber.
[02:15.01]What if it's really expensive bottles of wine? Or a suit of armor.
[02:19.05](Video Game Sounds) What if there's ancient Indian arrowheads under there?
[02:23.35]What if it's gold bars? Oh, you think?
[02:26.48]For God sakes, why don't you go under the house and look?
[02:32.27](Man) â™?Hey, hey â™?
[02:34.36]â™?Hey, hey Hey, hey â™?
[02:38.40]â™?Hey, hey Hey â™ªâ™ª
[02:47.04]Hey, Cam. Cam, where did we get this dolly from?
[02:49.54]From Janice and Olivia. They brought it over yesterday. Lily loves it.
[02:52.79]Seems a little frilly, you know, coming from them.
[02:56.05]What, because they're lesbians? That's sort of an offense stereotype, don't you think?
[02:59.26]Yeah, I suppose. I'm sorry. Oh, hey, did they bring back our coffee maker?
[03:02.85]No. It was too big. They were on their motorcycle.
[03:06.68]We got off to an awkward start with our pediatrician, a very nice Asian lady-
[03:09.77]Irrelevant. Named Dr. Miura.
[03:11.48]So I took the bold step of inviting her over for brunch.
[03:14.23](Chuckles) I'm sorry. Uh, bold?
[03:16.61]She said no patient had ever done it before.
[03:18.49]Yeah. Subtext, "This is weird."
[03:20.91]I didn't hear any subtext.
[03:23.37]Do you hear any now?
[03:27.08](Exhales) I don't even know why we're doing this.
[03:29.50]Because what if Lily gets sick and there's a Tamiflu shortage?
[03:32.54]Who do you think's gonna get that medicine?
[03:34.34]The patient she likes, that's who.
[03:36.09]Well, maybe if you bake her a cake, she'll give us free X-rays.
[03:38.88]It's all about making connections.
[03:40.47]Why do you think the dentist gives me all that free stuff?
[03:42.72]Um, because he's a huge queen and he has a big crush on you.
[03:47.31]Really? Do you think so?
[03:49.35](Manny) Mom? (Gloria) Hmm?
[03:51.69]- I have a fever. - Ay, mi amor. Come here and I feel you.
[03:54.69]Ooh. I don't wanna get you sick. It could be fatal.
[03:57.40]Then by all means, stand next to me.
[03:59.44]Let me feel you.
[04:02.74]Ay, papi, but you're not warm.
[04:04.99]Uh, probably because you were cooking and your hands are warm.
[04:08.95]I better skip the party tomorrow just to be safe.
[04:11.71]Oh. Yeah, the party.
[04:15.58]What? (Whispering) The party.
[04:18.25]I understand about 20% of what goes on around here.
[04:21.51]The party is at an amusement park,
[04:23.84]and Manny's afraid of roller coasters. Poor kid.
[04:26.93]I don't know where he gets his fear from...
[04:28.93]because his father's not afraid of anything.
[04:30.93]No bulls, no heights, no helicopters, no fast cars-
[04:34.19]But go to dinner with him and wait for the check to come.
[04:36.69]Then you'll see fear in his eyes.
[04:38.98]Like the waiter's a ghost.
[04:41.53]Excited? Yeah.
[04:43.99]and his son, Little Ponce. We're like Ponce de LeÃ³n
[04:48.37]Who's that? Famous treasure hunters.
[04:51.29]His name was Ponce? He'd get made fun of at my school.
[04:54.96]They'd probably call him "Pants." (Laughing)
[04:57.84]Pants. (Chuckles)
[04:59.84]Or maybe, um, "Fancy Ponce."
[05:02.09](Laughs) That's a good one.
[05:04.01]All right.
[05:06.55]Let's do this. (Squeaking)
[05:08.18]Oh! Hey! Wow.
[05:09.81]You okay, Dad? Yeah. Yeah, I am.
[05:12.02]Yep. Gonna take a little more than getting trapped...
[05:15.06]in a small, dark space with a wild animal to rattle your old man.
[05:17.73]All right. (Phil) You never want your kids to see you scared.
[05:19.98]You wanna be that rock that they can grab ahold of in a stormy sea.
[05:24.28]Actually, a rock would sink. So a floating rock.
[05:27.45]Let's start over. It's windy, and you've got a lot of papers.
[05:31.70]Okay. Let's do this, buddy.
[05:35.08](Clears Throat)
[05:38.42](Squeaking) Okay! Good recon.
[05:40.46]Got the lay of the land, so-
[05:42.51]Aren't we going in? Yep, we are.
[05:45.26]But won't it be fun if we did it with ski goggles and barbecue tools?
[05:50.05]I guess. Yeah.
[05:52.26]Yeah. Let's do that. All right.
[05:57.23]Can I just say that is a lovely outfit.
[05:59.65]Oh. Thank you. Well, it's just nice to see you out of your lab coat.
[06:02.78]You actually have quite a nice figure.
[06:05.03]Take it down a notch. We're trying to make a friend, not initiate a three-way.
[06:09.37]Oh.
[06:11.78]- Lily looks great. - (Cameron) Do you think so?
[06:14.79]Shouldn't she have more teeth? I see these kids running around at the park,
[06:17.41]and they look like sharks.
[06:19.46]Don't worry. She's perfect.
[06:21.21]Aren't you, Lily? Oh, look how calm she is with you.
[06:24.34]She's usually very fidgety around new people.
[06:26.34]Well, I just think she senses you're gonna be a good friend for her...
[06:28.84]during good times and- and flu season.
[06:31.97]Mommy.
[06:33.85](Choking) Did she just-
[06:36.73]Did she just say-
[06:39.94]Well, her first word...
[06:42.11]was every gay father's worst nightmare.
[06:44.40]"Mommy." Oh.
[06:49.49]Jay, he won't admit it,
[06:52.74]but I know that Manny's sad because he's missing the party.
[06:55.24]Why don't we take him somewhere to take his mind off it, hmm?
[06:58.00]I could have guessed he'd have trouble with roller coasters.
[07:00.00]That kid gets woozy at barbershops when they spin his chair towards the mirror.
[07:03.17]How about we take him to the pier and go fishing, huh? Manny!
[07:06.55]He likes to fish? Yeah.
[07:08.63]He comes from a long line of fishermen and smugglers. But I encourage the fishing.
[07:13.80]- Manny, you like to fish? - Fishing? Yeah.
[07:16.47]You want to go to the pier today?
[07:18.56]Is this a trick to see if I'm really sick? No.
[07:22.35]Maybe the fresh air will make you feel better.
[07:25.11]Well, then yeah, 'cause there's no place where I'm more at one with-
[07:28.44]Just get your coat.
[07:29.90]Are you nervous? Shut up, Alex.
[07:31.91]I was just asking. I'd be nervous if I were you.
[07:34.41]Alex, leave your sister alone. She's gonna be fine.
[07:36.54]As long as I don't get the same guy. He's so mean.
[07:38.91]You probably will. You won't.
[07:40.50]He hates me. He doesn't hate you.
[07:42.71]He yelled at me. You drove into the bushes.
[07:45.09]Oh, no. It's him. Please don't be for me. Please don't be for me.
[07:48.01]Please don't be for me. Please don't be me. Hi.
[07:52.09]Oh, thank God.
[07:54.30]Well, come on. I don't have all day.
[07:58.06]I'm gonna throw up. Okay, no. This is what you're gonna do.
[08:01.31]You're gonna get in that car, put on your seat belt...
[08:03.48]and take three deep breaths and relax.
[08:05.77]This guy sees hundreds of kids every day.
[08:08.07]He probably doesn't even remember you, all right? Okay.
[08:10.15]Yo. Let's move it, two strikes.
[08:12.91](Sighs)
[08:15.37](Breathing Heavily) That's more than three breaths, honey.
[08:20.04]See how much better this is?
[08:22.83]The truck goes in. It gets video.
[08:24.83]And then we get a preview of whatever's in there. How ingenious is that, huh?
[08:27.59]Are you just scared to go in?
[08:30.21]Why would you say that?
[08:32.26]Well, when you stuck your head in, you screamed a little.
[08:34.84]I told you. That was the house settling.
[08:36.85]Besides, this is so much cooler. This is how NASA does it.
[08:40.68]Now, hand me the ltty Bitty Book Light.
[08:43.56]Yeah. Final piece of the puzzle.
[08:47.52](Lmitates Explosion) Blast off.
[08:54.20](Motor Whirring)
[08:56.20]Hey, Dad? Yeah?
[08:57.78]How are you supposed to steer if you don't know where you're going?
[09:00.49]Stay in the present, buddy. Gotta do it by feel.
[09:04.25]Gotta get all Jedi on it.
[09:16.09]- (Motor Grinding) - Uh-oh.
[09:18.68]- Did you just lose my truck? - No.
[09:20.56]You just lost my truck! No, I didn't!
[09:22.27]That was my truck! Grandpa just gave it to me!
[09:24.31]- I told you to stay in the present! - Stop yelling!
[09:30.19]- Truce? - Yeah. Sorry.
[09:36.24]This is delicious.
[09:38.24]Oh. Thank you. The recipe's from the now-defunct Gourmet magazine.
[09:41.83]Why do all the things I love go away?
[09:44.83]Look, I don't even think she said the "M" word.
[09:49.13]No, we heard it. It was clear as day. I- I just don't know what we've done wrong.
[09:53.42]I quit my job so I could stay at home with her.
[09:56.63](Tearfully) But maybe it's not enough.
[09:58.34]Maybe we're not providing her with the feminine energy that she needs.
[10:03.47]- (Sobs) - Yeah, I wouldn't be too concerned about that.
[10:08.98]You- You know it's because you're Asian, right?
[10:11.27]Cam. No, I'm sorry. What?
[10:13.28]Am I just supposed to ignore the giant panda in the room?
[10:17.15]Pandas are from China. I- Well, it doesn't matter.
[10:20.03]Okay, okay. I think what my hysterical partner is just trying to say, if I may,
[10:24.66]that for the first six months of her life,
[10:26.66]Lily was raised by very loving Asian women, in an orphanage,
[10:30.96]with whom she clearly bonded.
[10:33.05]And then suddenly you come in with all of your Asian-ness...
[10:36.92]and-and-and breasts and womb, lady bits-
[10:40.43]and it all just comes rushing back to her, and I-
[10:43.64]You guys are overreacting.
[10:46.93]I'm sure Lily just strung a couple of random syllables together,
[10:50.52]and they happen to sound something like that word.
[10:53.27]But that's all. (Laughs)
[10:57.95]- Do you really think that? - Of course.
[11:00.36]- She's right. - We're being ridiculous.
[11:02.20]- We're being ridiculous. - Your daddies are being ridiculous.
[11:06.25]Mommy.
[11:08.25]Okay. Well- (Silverware Clattering)
[11:10.75]- Mr. Tucker- - Okay. No, no, no.
[11:13.54](Weeping) She's made her choice! She's made her choice.
[11:15.88]All right, left turn. Here?
[11:18.47]At the intersection, yeah. Okay.
[11:21.05](Turn Signal Clicking) Left.
[11:23.35]What? I said left. You're going right.
[11:26.10]Wait. No, wait. I'm trying, okay? Pull over.
[11:29.02]- No, I can do this! - Pull over now.
[11:33.65]- Why are you crying? - Why do you hate me?
[11:37.23]Oh, hell. Haley, I don't hate you.
[11:40.36]You seem like a nice girl. You remind me of my daughter.
[11:43.49]Which is why I want you to live a long and happy life...
[11:46.45]and be safe and not hurt my daughter.
[11:50.66]I really want my license.
[11:52.96]I've been practicing a lot, I swear. (Sniffles)
[11:55.67]- You gonna drink and drive? - No, sir.
[11:57.59]- You gonna text and drive? - No, sir.
[12:00.38]All right. Let's start this from the beginning.
[12:05.14]Could you smile first?
[12:08.10]I'll be less nervous if you smile.
[12:10.27](Sniffles)
[12:15.40]Okay, that didn't help.
[12:17.86]Just go.
[12:20.99](Gulls Cawing)
[12:23.66](Manny) Today feels like a good day for halibut.
[12:26.16]Hey, Jay, did I ever tell you about the time...
[12:28.20]I used peanut butter and jelly for bait and I caught a thresher shark?
[12:31.96]I don't know. You tell me a lot of funny things.
[12:34.33]Why are we going this way?
[12:36.63]It's just another way to go.
[12:38.55]Uh-oh. Something's going on.
[12:40.26]What are you talking about? Wake up, old man.
[12:43.01]She's trying to get me on that roller coaster.
[12:45.22](People Screaming)
[12:46.80]No, she's not. Yes, I am.
[12:49.14]- What? - Told you.
[12:50.89]Manny, you have to face your fears.
[12:53.14]That's why we're here? Why didn't you let me in on your little plan?
[12:56.65]Because you're the worst liar. He would have seen right through you.
[12:59.32]I don't wanna go on the roller coaster.
[13:01.36]Manny, you were afraid to light the barbecue,
[13:03.15]but now your eyebrows have grown back...
[13:06.03]and your salmon is legendary.
[13:08.24]What if I fall out? I will catch you.
[13:10.70]That's not possible. He would crush you.
[13:13.41]What if I throw up?
[13:15.00]I will clean it up. It wouldn't be the first time.
[13:17.08]Geez, these are new shoes.
[13:19.54]You're not gonna let up, are you?
[13:21.17]Baby, I think you know the answer.
[13:25.18](Sighs) Fine. Let's get it over with.
[13:27.59](Laughs) That's my boy. Vamos, Jay.
[13:30.56]No, I'm not going on that. That's bad for my back.
[13:33.35]Your back is fine. I got an inner-ear thing.
[13:36.31]Oh, please. Don't tell me you're scared too. Scared?
[13:39.36]What is this "scared" stuff?
[13:41.40]What am I, a child? I'm not scared.
[13:43.15]You see? You're the worst liar.
[13:44.86]Well, if he's not going, I'm not going.
[13:48.53]Oh, for God's sake, fine! I'll go alone.
[13:50.45]Here. Take my girlie purse and you my floppy hat,
[13:54.50]and if you need it, there's the ladies' room.
[13:59.96]I'm not man enough to fight this.
[14:04.13]Here. Hold my purse.
[14:09.01]Oh, hell!
[14:15.98]What's taking them so long? I don't know.
[14:18.52]The only reason I'm not panicking is I haven't seen a giant geyser.
[14:22.48]You know, honey, I think I know why you don't wanna go tonight.
[14:25.28]Because school dances are lame? No.
[14:27.53]'Cause you don't know how to dance. That's not it.
[14:29.78]I can help you with that. Come on. Come on. Oh, God, no. No, Mom.
[14:32.62]Oh, yeah. Back in the day, I was quite the dancer.
[14:35.12]Oh, my God. You and Dad together suddenly makes so much sense.
[14:37.37]Mom. Mom, stop. Stop. â™ªâ™ª (Humming)
[14:40.08]Please, stop. I know how to dance.
[14:43.09]I just don't wanna be part of that freak show.
[14:45.46]Sweetheart, you're a beautiful girl. Someone will ask you to dance.
[14:49.22]I know that. It's just stupid.
[14:51.22]Somebody will ask you. Why do you keep saying that?
[14:54.18]Somebody will ask you.
[14:56.89]But what if they don't?
[14:58.98]Honey, if they don't,
[15:00.98]then you do the exact same thing I told your sister, okay?
[15:04.32]Take three deep breaths and relax.
[15:06.86]Even the advice I get is a hand-me-down.
[15:08.99]Mom, I did it! I passed!
[15:12.12]Oh! Oh, my God!
[15:13.28]I got my license! (Claire) Congratulations!
[15:15.08]I have my license! I got my license!
[15:17.04]Car's not in "park." Oh. Oops.
[15:19.16]- (Brake Lever Clicks) - You better run to that counter.
[15:21.17]Go. Right now. Run! Run!
[15:26.96]Still can't believe you lost my truck. It's gone, buddy. Let it go.
[15:30.68]You know, maybe it's better we don't solve this little mystery.
[15:34.72]Sometimes treasure's more sparkly in your imagination.
[15:38.14]Or it could be gold or baseball cards or pirate maps.
[15:41.81]Do you really think there could be pirate maps under there?
[15:45.32]I'm a hundred percent sure it's possible.
[15:47.86]All right. I'm going in. What?
[15:51.45](Hyperventilating)
[15:55.83]Really? Buddy.
[15:58.25]Whoa.
[16:02.21]What do you see? Nothing. It's really dark in here.
[16:05.42]Wait a minute. I think I see my truck.
[16:08.09]It's right over there by the- Uh-oh.
[16:10.51]What? I think I'm stuck.
[16:12.88]How are you stuck? My belt loop got caught on a pipe.
[16:16.39]And it's hot. Have you tried wiggling?
[16:18.97]Dad, it's hot! Hurry!
[16:21.14]I'm coming, buddy! And hurry. There's spiders in here.
[16:23.81]Oh!
[16:26.82]Coming!
[16:28.82]I'm sorry if we got all weird in there.
[16:30.86]No. It was fine.
[16:32.86]Well, we'd like to say it's different than how it usually is,
[16:35.12]but you've seen us enough to know that that's not true.
[16:37.91]Guys, listen. I had a very complicated relationship with my mother.
[16:41.62]She was born in Japan- crazy traditional.
[16:44.92]She didn't want me to become a doctor. She wanted me to get married and have kids.
[16:48.13]But my father, we would talk...
[16:51.05]and he would actually listen to what I wanted.
[16:53.80]Anyway, what I'm trying to say...
[16:55.89]is having a mother isn't always what it's cracked up to be.
[16:59.47]Oh! Thank you. Well, thank you.
[17:02.48]And if you ask me,
[17:04.48]having two fathers who care as much as you do...
[17:06.94]makes Lily the luckiest little girl in the world.
[17:09.19]Oh! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you for that.
[17:11.19]That's very sweet. Thanks. Thank you.
[17:13.24]And how are things with you and your mom now?
[17:15.82]Uh- (Engine Starts)
[17:17.74]The only way she'll be happy is if I'm some Asian stereotype.
[17:20.58]But that just isn't me.
[17:27.67]I didn't see those!
[17:34.76]I'm coming, buddy. Over here.
[17:37.26]That's- (Spits) A spider web. Oh, God.
[17:40.47]My boy was in trouble,
[17:42.06]so I put my fears aside, and I came to his rescue.
[17:45.64]Now, does that make me a hero?
[17:47.98]Yes, it does.
[17:49.77]Everything's gonna be okay. (Groans)
[17:51.73]Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. (Grunts)
[17:55.65]There. Thanks, Dad.
[17:58.03]Hey, that's what dads do. Let's get out of here.
[18:00.66]I want my truck. Really?
[18:03.41]It was a Christmas gift.
[18:05.54]Could you go get it?
[18:08.83]Yeah. Yeah.
[18:10.92]Sure. Let's go- Let's go through it.
[18:15.17](Grunting)
[18:16.93]Yeah. There it is.
[18:22.89]Got it.
[18:24.89]You okay? Yeah. Are you okay?
[18:28.19]You know what? I am okay.
[18:31.27]Hey. Hey.
[18:32.86]We did it. Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
[18:35.28]We're under the house. (Laughing)
[18:38.07]What the heck. We're down here.
[18:40.91]Why don't we see what we got, huh? Yeah.
[18:44.29]Two intrepid explorers...
[18:47.46]make their way on a journey- (Both Scream)
[18:51.38]Dead bodies! (Screaming)
[18:53.46](Phil) We called the police and got a bunch of detectives over.
[18:56.34]Turns out it was the last owner's Halloween decorations,
[18:59.72]which is pretty funny.
[19:01.72]Least I thought it was.
[19:04.06]Everybody's afraid of something, right?
[19:07.10]Heights, clowns, tight spaces.
[19:10.73]You like it, Jay? (Laughing)
[19:14.94]I did it! Those are things you get over.
[19:18.40]But then there's our children.
[19:20.82]Will they fit in?
[19:27.12]Will they be safe?
[19:30.33]Those are fears you never get past.
[19:32.63]So sometimes all you can do...
[19:35.88]is take a deep breath, pull 'em close...
[19:39.22]and hope for the best.
[19:42.01]- Bye! - Eyes on the road.
[19:43.60]- Love you! - Eyes on the road.
[19:45.60]Whoo! Oh, God.
[19:47.18]I mean, things don't always work out.
[19:50.77]Oh. Cam, I think she wants her doll.
[19:53.15]I don't know where it is. (Child's Voice) Mommy.
[19:58.19]Mommy.
[20:03.20]When you squeeze the doll, it says "Mommy."
[20:05.16]Did-Did you know that- Not a clue.
[20:07.37](Laughs) The doll says "Mommy."
[20:09.70]The doll says "Mommy." The doll says "Mommy."
[20:12.21](Both Laughing)
[20:14.21](Phil) But you gotta love it when they do.
[20:20.80]Hey, Dad. Hmm?
[20:22.30]Mom says there's an old trunk in the attic.
[20:24.51]Oh, yeah. My grandpa's old steamer trunk.
[20:26.60]In this movie I saw, there was this old trunk...
[20:29.60]and there's a secret compartment.
[20:31.64]And when you opened it, there was a whole bunch of paintings,
[20:34.35]by the world's greatest painters, hidden in the war.
[20:37.19]My grandpa was in the war.
[20:40.24]Should we go up there? Totally. It could also be diamonds.
[20:42.90]Or a samurai sword. Or the Declaration of Independence.
[20:46.91]You know, it almost doesn't even matter what's up there.
[20:51.16]What matters is what you do with the money from what's up there.
[20:54.33]We could get a motorboat. Or a robotic gutter cleaner.
[20:57.79]Or an indoor pool. Or a two-man submarine.
