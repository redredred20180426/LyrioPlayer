[00:03.50]Happy Valentine's Day.
[00:05.79]Oh, happy Valentine's Day.
[00:11.67](Clicks Tongue) Aw! Oh!
[00:14.68]So, Fratelli's tonight? Hello, cannoli canoe.
[00:19.10](Jay) I like it. Nice fit.
[00:21.43]Swanky material.
[00:23.48]Jay, you look so strong and sexy.
[00:26.27]Like an Olympic wrestler, but with money. (Both Laugh)
[00:29.73]Your turn. Okay. (Chuckles)
[00:32.53]This is my favorite day in America. Happy Valentine's Day, gorgeous.
[00:36.28](Gasps) They're huge!
[00:39.04]Oh, my God. Yeah, those will work.
[00:41.87]Beautiful. You can wear 'em tonight.
[00:44.46]I have a surprise. (Gasps)
[00:47.13]Don't tell me you're finally taking me salsa dancing!
[00:52.80]And who's David Brenner? Only a Vegas legend.
[00:56.68]Is he a magician? 'Cause I love magicians.
[00:59.39]He's a comedian. A comedian? It's Valentine's Day.
[01:03.64]I thought we were going salsa dancing, not to watch a comedian.
[01:06.40]You're gonna love him. Trust me.
[01:08.36]The guy's hilarious. Okay, tell me one of his jokes.
[01:11.86]He doesn't do jokes.
[01:13.53]Does he have a mallet? No.
[01:16.07]So then how does he get hit in the head?
[01:17.99]He doesn't get hit in the head.
[01:19.66]He- He makes observations.
[01:21.58]He tells the truth in a funny way.
[01:24.00]Come on. He's been on Johnny Carson a hundred times.
[01:27.17]Who the hell is Johnny Carson? Oh, for God's sake.
[01:29.50]Gloria and I are from different generations.
[01:31.67]And I won't lie- It isn't always easy.
[01:33.97]I mean, last week she thought Simon and Garfunkel were my lawyers.
[01:37.84]No I didn't. It was a joke.
[01:40.35]I don't get it. Maybe that's because there's no mallet.
[01:43.27]Yeah, I wish I had a mallet right now.
[01:46.52](Mitchell) ...was to stay in Northern California.
[01:48.52]Did you indicate to her how long that you were gonna take?
[01:52.11]Happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day.
[01:55.78]Happy Valentine's Day, Daddy. Happy Valentine's Day, Lily.
[01:58.78](Clears Throat) Notice anything different?
[02:02.03]Oh, that is cute. Cute?
[02:03.83]We spent a lot of time on this. (Chuckles)
[02:05.96]I don't see how. You just cut up one of your boas.
[02:08.54]Uh- Actually, no. We repurposed it.
[02:11.00]It was sort of a Bob Mackie meets Martha Stewart project.
[02:13.71]Okay. Well, we just thought it would be a nice surprise.
[02:15.97]It's hardly a surprise. I mean, you dress her up for every holiday.
[02:19.26]I was giving her a bath last night,
[02:20.85]and I still saw traces of Martin Luther King behind her ear.
[02:23.06]- All right. Not in the spirit. We get it. - No, I'm-I'm sorry.
[02:25.81]No. It's adorable. I just-
[02:27.81]I'm really nervous about my closing argument.
[02:29.81]Oh, you've been rehearsing for weeks. You're gonna be great.
[02:32.06]Let's hope so. Hey, and I was wondering-
[02:34.32]Since you're gonna be in court all day- You can open the chocolates.
[02:38.36]Score. (Doorbell Rings)
[02:42.62]Hi, Dylan. Happy Valentine's Day, Mrs. Dunphy.
[02:46.75]Oh. Dylan, thank you. That is so sweet.
[02:50.04]You know, all women should look as tasty as you when they're old.
[02:53.59]Huh. Conflicted.
[02:55.34]Hey, baby.
[02:56.88]Hey. Take this sweet gift as a token of my affection,
[03:00.05]my unending love and admiration-
[03:02.05]Oh, my God. Yay, it's big!
[03:05.43](Gasps) Oh, my God.
[03:07.43]I love it. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
[03:10.64]Seriously, you gotta put a black light on it. It'll blow your mind.
[03:15.02]Wow! Dylan, I didn't know you could paint. Oh, I didn't.
[03:17.86]I just took a photo and I put it through this program that turns it into a painting.
[03:21.57]Oh. Oh.
[03:22.66]So you two actually did...
[03:25.12]that. Uh-huh.
[03:27.24]Yeah. Okay. Let's go put this over my bed.
[03:29.62]Not- No, no. Mm-mmm.
[03:31.37]You don't need to be in the bedroom at all.
[03:33.46]I'll take it.
[03:36.46](Phil) Did he trump me? D-Money.
[03:38.71]You tell me. He made a painting out of a photograph one time.
[03:41.97]I have hand-picked a card,
[03:44.64]drawn a heart in the steam on the medicine cabinet,
[03:46.97]and taken Claire to Fratelli's,
[03:49.06]a family-style Italian restaurant,
[03:51.31]for 17 years in a row.
[03:53.31]Yeah, he got me. He got me.
[03:55.94](Man) â™?Hey, hey â™?
[03:57.94]â™?Hey, hey Hey, hey â™?
[04:02.07]â™?Hey, hey Hey â™ªâ™ª
[04:06.95]Bye, honey. See you later.
[04:09.16]See you later. Phil, what is that?
[04:13.12]You know, we don't have to go to Fratelli's tonight.
[04:16.67]Okay, what do you have in mind?
[04:20.05]Well, I thought you might enjoy a night at a hotel.
[04:25.39]I would, but would you and the kids be okay?
[04:28.01]I meant together. Yes, I know.
[04:30.39]Oh. I know. I know. I got it.
[04:32.60]So, what do you think?
[04:37.02]I think you're not getting any sleep tonight,
[04:39.57]so you might want to take a nap at work today.
[04:43.53]I always do.
[04:48.37]Phil? Sweetie.
[04:50.87]As long as we're talking about being a little bit naughty,
[04:54.92]what would you say to a little role-playing?
[05:00.09]Role-play? Mm-hmm.
[05:03.42]I'm in. I'll set up sleepovers for the kids.
[05:06.97]And I'll swing by after work to pick you up. No, no.
[05:10.85]Why don't you meet me in the hotel bar and see if you can pick me up there.
[05:16.06]Careful, lady. You're gonna wake up a sexy sleeping giant.
[05:22.15](English Accent) Perhaps I'll be Reginald Appleby,
[05:24.82]an English gentleman in town for a polo match.
[05:27.95]Phil- Or...
[05:29.74](Chinese Accent) Honorable businessman from Hong Kong.
[05:33.37]Kinda wrecking it.
[05:37.96](German Accent) It's not a big deal, Claire.
[05:39.96]I just train tigers for a living.
[05:41.96]- (Inhales Sharply) - (Normal Voice) Too- No?
[05:54.52]Are these rose petals? Yes, to commemorate our love.
[05:57.60](Sighs) I had to settle. Well, your mom might think so,
[06:00.23]but a lot of people think I'm a catch. No. The case.
[06:02.40]I- I was this close to nailing it,
[06:04.86]and then my client gets scared and settles. I'm sorry.
[06:09.82]Maybe you'd like a chocolate. Notice that I have not eaten any of the chocolates.
[06:14.95]There were two levels. You know it and I know it.
[06:18.21]This is so frustrating.
[06:20.46]I had one of the greatest closing arguments of all time-
[06:23.67]all about the big government rolling over the little guy,
[06:26.01]and I even had this great moment at the end...
[06:28.05]where I would point to the state seal and I'd say, "Shame!"
[06:31.14]Oh, that's what you were doing in the shower.
[06:33.22]I was a little worried. (Doorbell Rings)
[06:35.22]Um, that's Manny. I said we would watch him tonight. I hope you don't mind.
[06:38.56]I didn't know you were gonna be going through all this.
[06:40.65]No, it's fine. It might be nice to have him around.
[06:42.73](Chuckles) He always make me laugh. Hi, Manny.
[06:45.73]The universe is cold and loveless.
[06:47.53]- Uh-oh. - Uh-oh. Bad Valentine's Day?
[06:50.74](Sighs) I went for the gold- Fiona Gunderson.
[06:54.08]I poured my heart and soul into a poem, left it on her desk.
[06:58.16]I even burned the edges to make it look fancy.
[07:00.83]- And she didn't like it? - Oh, she loved it.
[07:03.17]But this kid Durkas told her he wrote it.
[07:05.38]Well, Manny, why-why didn't you just tell her the truth?
[07:07.97]She was already gone.
[07:09.68]And she's on a date with him at my favorite restaurant, Great Shakes.
[07:12.85]How do you know all this? I invited her in the poem.
[07:15.51]Right after the line of, "My love is deeper than the Great Lakes."
[07:19.48]- Okay, well, this is unacceptable. - Oh, boy. Here we go.
[07:22.65]No, it's not that big of a deal. This is what we're gonna do.
[07:25.15]We're gonna shoot over to Great Shakes, get a table.
[07:26.94]Manny can reclaim the love of his life.
[07:28.86]You and I can get a couple Mudslides.
[07:30.57]I don't know.
[07:32.32]Durkas is gonna be there. I've seen the kid do a pull-up.
[07:36.20]Hey, Manny, it's Valentine's Day.
[07:38.20]It's not the day you run away from love.
[07:40.21]It's the day you track it down, tie it up and take it home.
[07:42.83]Now, if we can pull this off, you and your little lady friend...
[07:45.29]will be belly up to a ice cream counter having a milk shake with two straws.
[07:48.26]What do you say?
[07:50.59]I like it.
[07:52.34](Brenner) Thank you. Thank you.
[07:54.51]Scientists- They don't know why this is true,
[07:57.31]but it's true.
[07:59.06]Women with big rear ends live longer.
[08:04.10]Man who tell 'em that don't.
[08:07.90]Did you read about this man,
[08:09.90]a 91 -year old bank robber in Texas?
[08:13.11]He goes into a bank-
[08:16.83]"The hell did I want?"
[08:19.08]They had over 4,000 photos of him escaping from the bank.
[08:22.71](Laughter, Applause)
[08:26.25]See?
[08:28.21]He's funny, huh?
[08:30.21](Chattering) â™ªâ™ª (Piano: Smooth Jazz)
[08:40.27]Mind if I join you?
[08:42.64]I'm Clive. Clive Bixby.
[08:46.61]Yes, I can see that. I'm Juliana.
[08:49.90]So, Clive, you in town for a convention,
[08:52.53]or do you just forget your name a lot?
[08:55.32]Pretty kitty has nails.
[08:58.03]I like that.
[09:01.54]I'm in town for a trade show.
[09:03.54]I design high-end electroacoustic transducers.
[09:07.84]Wow, that is very...
[09:09.96]specific.
[09:12.46]It's a fancy way of saying I get things to make noise.
[09:15.97]Hmm. (Softly) Two.
[09:17.97]So, what's your story?
[09:21.35]Miss America Pageant in town?
[09:24.44]You're a pretty smooth talker, Clive.
[09:27.35]I'm pretty smooth all over.
[09:31.40]Sir, there's no smoking in here.
[09:33.40]Oh, that's fine. I'm not actually a smoker.
[09:39.87]You're quite the Boy Scout, Clive.
[09:42.62]Tell me, would you be interested in earning a merit badge tonight?
[09:46.83]Do you know anything about tying knots?
[09:51.13]I probably shouldn't be talking to you.
[09:55.17]I'm a married man. Ah.
[09:57.22]Well, I just so happen to like married men.
[10:01.35]Tell me about your wife. Well, she's beautiful, of course.
[10:04.56]Really? Well, if she's so very beautiful, why are you here with me?
[10:08.35]Because she's always so tired...
[10:10.36]and she's always making lists of things for me to do.
[10:13.86]Maybe if you did them she wouldn't be so tired. Oh, no.
[10:16.82]She can make lists for days.
[10:19.87]But back to your mouth and how sexy it is.
[10:22.33]Mm-mmm. I wanna go back to these alleged lists and your nagging wife.
[10:25.75]I'm not talking about you.
[10:27.87](Exhales)
[10:30.21]I didn't mean that. Can we try this again?
[10:32.21]Yeah.
[10:37.42]So if your wife is so beautiful,
[10:40.47]why are you here with me?
[10:43.31]Because...
[10:45.64]I respect her too much...
[10:48.89]to do to her...
[10:50.65]what I'm going to do to you?
[10:54.57]Oh, jackpot.
[10:57.28]I'll be right back, Clive.
[11:07.25](Chattering)
[11:09.33]Do you have eyes on her? Is she here?
[11:11.58]Two o'clock- blonde at the back table.
[11:13.88]Yep. I have a visual.
[11:16.51](Mitchell) Let's not talk like that anymore. Over.
[11:19.17]Okay, this is it. I'm off to win the heart of my beloved.
[11:24.68]Well, this is nice. I mean, if we can't have our own Valentine's Day,
[11:27.72]it's nice that we can give somebody else one.
[11:29.81]All right, Cam. I'm sorry.
[11:31.40]I'm sor- I'm sorry I have not been attentive.
[11:33.40]I've been spending the last five months...
[11:35.11]pouring my core beliefs into the greatest speech that I will ever write,
[11:38.11]and then that moment gets taken away.
[11:40.11]- Hey, buddy. How'd it go? - I can't do it, not while Durkas is there.
[11:45.16]He has the natural confidence. I admire it and fear it.
[11:47.95]We will deal with him directly. We need a plan.
[11:53.63](Clicks Tongue) Could you be more dramatic?
[11:58.30](Exaggerating) We need a plan.
[12:00.09](Laughter) In Oregon,
[12:02.51]the state legislature ratified a, uh, bill...
[12:06.60]that from now on it is a crime...
[12:09.68]to have sex in Oregon with a farm animal.
[12:13.65]How ugly are the women in Oregon?
[12:17.02](Laughter, Applause)
[12:19.44]He's funny, Jay. I know. See?
[12:22.57]- I can tell you're not- you're not from Oregon. - No.
[12:24.78]You are gorgeous. Thank you.
[12:27.91]Thank you for bringing your father to the show.
[12:30.41]Oh, no. I'm her husband, Dave.
[12:32.96]- No kidding. - Yeah.
[12:34.83]What's it like to be married to someone who was there when the Bible was written?
[12:40.80]What was it called then? Just "The Testament"?
[12:43.30]That's, uh- That's- That's good stuff.
[12:47.05]Oh, now he's trying to turn out the light.
[12:56.36]Phone call. Over there.
[13:00.61]Hello? Uh, yes. Hello.
[13:02.61]Mr. Durkas? Yeah.
[13:04.36](Southern Accent) This is Don Jolly...
[13:06.07]with the Great Shakes corporate office, and I have good news for you.
[13:08.45]You have been selected to take part in a random survey...
[13:12.08]that you could win cash and prizes.
[13:14.41]Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?
[13:16.54]Yeah, sure. Okay, just a few simple questions for you.
[13:20.09]Would you please rank your favorite ice creams at Great Shakes...
[13:24.09]from least favorite to favorite?
[13:26.13]- I don't know 'em by heart. - There should be a menu right there to your right.
[13:30.01]To your right. Mm-hmm. There you go.
[13:35.35]- Oh. Hi, Manny. - Hi, Fiona. Can I join you?
[13:38.61]I guess so. Thanks.
[13:43.57]And you don't have to worry about him cheating. That's for sure.
[13:45.86]Because if he does, you'll catch him...
[13:48.45]when he comes home with two sets of teeth in his mouth.
[13:51.03]Yeah.
[13:53.08]So tell me, on the wedding night, what-what did he do?
[13:55.41]Did he say he wanted to change into something comfortable and go into a coma?
[13:59.71]Listen, I gotta use the men's room.
[14:01.25]Nuh-uh. I gotta use the men's room. I'll be right back.
[14:03.42]Where you going? Wait a minute. I'm only joking. That's what I do.
[14:06.51]You know, you're way younger than I am.
[14:08.43]You just don't look it.
[14:16.81]Clive, I have a little something for you.
[14:20.98]What is it?
[14:25.11]My dress. Oh, th-
[14:27.99]My bra. Oh, my G-
[14:31.53]My underwear.
[14:35.33]My God. Yeah.
[14:37.33]What do you say we take this upstairs?
[14:40.13]This is so much better than cheesy garlic bread.
[14:43.13]Mmm.
[14:45.76](Durkas) Chocolate. Uh-huh. Go on.
[14:48.22]Vanilla. I'm taking copious notes.
[14:50.22]Keep goin', Mr. Durkas.
[14:52.14]So, why would Ted say he wrote the poem if he didn't?
[14:54.97]Maybe because you're the cutest girl in school,
[14:56.98]and you have a laugh that makes science lab seem like recess.
[15:03.40]Would you be more or less inclined to visit a Great Shakes establishment...
[15:07.57]if you knew your satisfaction was guaranteed?
[15:10.07]That's a dumb question. Excuse me. It is not a dumb question, Mr. -
[15:12.87]Tarnation! He hung up. Then you can drop the accent.
[15:17.87]Delgado. What are you doing here?
[15:19.96]Discussing poetry. Maybe you'll like to recite some of yours.
[15:23.42](Ted) I'm not gonna recite anything.
[15:25.34]Just admit you didn't write the poem.
[15:27.42]I don't know what he's talking about.
[15:29.01]Get out of here before you get your butt kicked.
[15:30.84]I'm going over there. No, I got this.
[15:33.01](Exhales)
[15:36.56]Whoa! Whoa, sir! Sir? Turn around.
[15:39.43]Sir, you have no right to claim ownership of another person's work.
[15:43.56]- Who are you? - I'm a lawyer.
[15:46.07]You have a lawyer?
[15:47.98]It is one thing to lie,
[15:50.36]but then to bully this young man- it's unforgivable.
[15:53.07](Chattering Stops) And this is what's wrong with the world today.
[15:55.08]The big guy...
[15:57.24]thinks that he can roll right over the little guy...
[15:59.25]until the little guy says, "Enough."
[16:02.58]And that's what this little guy's doing-
[16:04.67]right here, right now.
[16:06.92]Can we stop calling me "little guy"? I'm in the 40th percentile.
[16:09.38]Shh. I got this.
[16:11.51]Ted Durkas clearly did not write that poem.
[16:15.18]I know it. He knows it.
[16:18.39]Deep down in your heart, Fiona-
[16:20.56](Exhales) You know it too.
[16:27.98]Shame!
[16:30.49]Fine! Whatever. I stole his stupid poem.
[16:32.57]- (Fiona) You did? - I told you.
[16:34.53]There you go.
[16:36.07]I only did it because I had the feelings,
[16:38.99]I just didn't know how to show 'em.
[16:40.87]Really? That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever done for me.
[16:46.00]You've gotta be kidding me.
[16:47.84]- Let's get out of here. This chick's crazy. - Seriously.
[16:50.92]I've never seen you like that.
[16:52.92]You have no idea how good that felt.
[16:54.68]Well, happy Valentine's Day, counselor.
[16:57.80]This is all happening so fast, Juliana.
[17:00.43]I know, and I have to be home to my husband by midnight.
[17:03.48]Ooh, a twist.
[17:07.98]Phil! Phil, my coat is stuck.
[17:10.65]Who's Phil? No, not now! Seriously.
[17:12.40]My coat is stuck. Oh, oh. Honey, take off your coat!
[17:14.70]Are you kidding me? Pull it. Oh, my goodness.
[17:17.07]Pull it. Come on. Come on.
[17:19.45](Claire) Oh, boy. Not good. Not good.
[17:21.62](Buzzer Sounds) (Escalator Stops)
[17:23.46](Gasps) Okay. Okay. Okay.
[17:26.12]Come on up. Treat 'em like they're regular stairs.
[17:28.17]It's okay. Come on through.
[17:29.92]Happy Valentine's Day. You look lovely.
[17:32.46]So do you. Not in a weird way. Yeah.
[17:34.63]How are you? Hi. Hi.
[17:36.30]Happy Valentine's- Let me just get in here. Let me get in here.
[17:38.72]Okay? Phil?
[17:39.89]Hey, Tom. Hi.
[17:41.56]How are you? Honey-
[17:43.43]Claire, you remember Tom Mickleson from the office and his wife, Susan.
[17:46.35]I do. Hey. Is your coat stuck?
[17:49.02]It is. It really is. It's in there pretty darn good.
[17:52.69]Why don't you take it off? Um, I'm freezing cold.
[17:57.03]At least let me give it a shot.
[17:58.62](Phil) Oh, I don't think- No, no, no. I got it.
[18:01.33]Mr. And Mrs. Dunphy? Hey.
[18:02.99]Principal Balaban. Hey, how are you?
[18:05.66](Claire) Hi. Who's Clive Bixby?
[18:08.25]Oh, uh, he makes speakers.
[18:11.59]He's actually in town for a trade show. Phil.
[18:14.05]My, are you stuck? Yeah, I am. A little bit.
[18:17.34]Why don't you take off that coat? Um, I'm chilly.
[18:19.68]It's really jammed in here.
[18:21.68]Let me in there. I'll get you. No, I think we're okay.
[18:24.35]Mrs. Dunphy?
[18:26.48]Are you kidding me?
[18:28.69]Hi! Luke's math teacher, Ms. Passwater.
[18:31.77](Chuckling) "Passwater."
[18:33.53](Laughter, Applause)
[18:35.11]Ah, Jay, papi, don't pay attention to what he's saying.
[18:38.03]He's just being funny. Because he points out the truth.
[18:40.53]Those people were laughing because they saw it too.
[18:43.66]What do you care what they think? I don't.
[18:46.08]I care what you think.
[18:48.25]I love you. You're my valentine. Yeah, for now.
[18:50.83]But what about when I'm 80 and I'm in a wheelchair, on oxygen?
[18:53.92]You still gonna want me?
[18:55.51]Do you think I'm so shallow that I'm gonna leave you when you're old?
[18:58.93]What if I gain a hundred pounds? You gonna leave me then?
[19:02.72]No. What's with the pause?
[19:05.77]Well, it's not exactly fair. I mean, I have to get old.
[19:08.64]You don't have to get fat. If I want to get fat, I get fat.
[19:11.56]Okay, fine. And if you do, I'll be there. You'll see.
[19:13.69]Yeah, watch me. Watch me, how I get fat.
[19:16.44]I can get fat. And I'll be there.
[19:20.78](Laughs) Good.
[19:23.37]You wanna go back in? No.
[19:25.37]I got a better idea.
[19:27.41]Let's go salsa dancing. This guy's not that funny.
[19:30.08](Gasps) Perfect.
[19:34.13]We're good! We're good! I talked to Maintenance.
[19:36.42]They're- They're- They're coming, so go on ahead.
[19:38.63]See you guys. See you later.
[19:41.13]See you in school. Good to see you guys.
[19:43.26]Maintenance is gonna take care of it.
[19:45.01]So we're fine. Okay. Okay, how long till they get here?
[19:48.18]I was faking it. No one's coming for us.
[19:50.27]Well, then, go and get them! Hurry!
[19:52.35]That was the most embarrassing moment of my life.
[19:55.15]Claire! Phil!
[19:57.19]Stand by.
[20:00.03]Hey.
[20:01.86]- What, did you get your belt stuck? - I did. Yeah.
[20:04.53]Take your coat off. Here, let me help you.
[20:06.16]No, no, Dad. Dad, I'm fine. Come on!
[20:08.08]What are you, naked under there?
[20:11.21]Aw, geez. It's okay.
[20:14.17]I got this. Okay.
[20:16.63]Claire, follow my lead, okay?
[20:19.80]Okay.
[20:27.89](Claire) Wow. Okay.
[20:30.73]Thank you. It has happened to me before.
[20:34.10]That was impressive.
[20:36.61]Take it down a notch, Clive.

[20:56.17](Claire) Hi, honey.
[20:57.84](Phil On Speaker) Hey, I just wanted to tell you how great you were last night.
[21:00.80]Uh, Phil- Sorry I got the, uh- the oil everywhere, but, heyâ€?
[21:04.84]Uh, sweetie- They're not our sheets, right?
[21:08.01]Honey- Honey, remember when the salesman told us...
[21:10.18]that the Sienna was built with the whole family in mind?
[21:12.52]Yeah. Well, the whole family just heard that.
[21:14.81]Uh- Uh- Guess-
[21:17.44]I guess the Bluetooth works.
[21:19.52]Mmm. Why did you have oil?
[21:22.69]Because, buddy, we were making French fries.
[21:26.03]In your room?
[21:27.62](Claire) Why don't you guys just pop in a DVD?
